## Checks before publication {#message-alerting}

While you are creating your message, alerts warn you when you need to take important actions before publishing your message.

Alerts are displayed on top right of the screen, as shown below:

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you do not see this button, no alert has been detected.

Two types of alerts can happen:

* **Warnings** refer to recommendations and best practices. For example, a message will display if the opt-out link is missing.

* **Errors** prevent you from publishing the message as long as they are not resolved. For example, a message will warn you that the subject line is missing.

All possible warnings and errors are detailed [below](#alerts-and-warnings).

>[!CAUTION]

> You need to resolve all **error** alerts before publication.

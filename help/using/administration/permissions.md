# Manage users and product profiles {#manage-permissions}

>[!IMPORTANT]

> Each of the procedures detailed below can only be carried out by a **[!UICONTROL Product]** or **[!UICONTROL System]** administrator. For more information on this, refer to the [Admin console documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/admin-roles.ug.html).

**[!UICONTROL Product profiles]** are sets of users that share the same permissions and sandboxes within your organization.

The [!DNL Journey Optimizer] product allows you to select between different out-of-the-box **[!UICONTROL Product profiles]** with different levels of permissions to assign to your users. For more information on the available **[!UICONTROL Product profiles]**, refer to this [page](ootb-product-profiles.md).

Each user belonging to a **[!UICONTROL Product profiles]** is entitled with the Adobe apps and services contained in the product.

You can also create your own **[!UICONTROL Product profiles]** if you want to fine-tune your users' access to certain functionalities or objects in the interface.

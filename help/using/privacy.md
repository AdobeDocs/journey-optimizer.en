# Privacy management with [!DNL Journey Optimizer]{#privacy}

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] is a powerful tool for processing large amounts of data, including personal information and sensitive data. In order to deliver better customer experiences, you need to collect and store your customers’ personal data. When using this data, it is important to understand and respect your customers’ privacy. New legal and organizational regulations are giving users the right to access or delete their personal data from your data stores upon request.

* **Personal Data** is information that can directly or indirectly identify a living individual.
* **Sensitive Personal Data** is information related to an individual’s race, political views, religious beliefs, criminal background, genetic information, health data, sexual preference, biometric information, as well as trade union membership.

The main legislations refer to the different entities that manage data as follows:

* A **Data Controller** is the authority that determines the means and purpose of collecting, using, and sharing personal data.
* A **Data Processor** is any individual or party that collects, uses, or shares personal data as directed by the Data Controller.
* A **Data Subject** is any living individual whose personal data is being collected, used or shared, and who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to that personal data.

As a company collecting and sharing personal data, you are the Data Controller, your clients are the Data Subjects and Adobe Experience Cloud acts as a Data Processor when handling their personal data as directed by you. Note that it is your responsibility as a Data Controller to handle the relationship with the Data Subjects.

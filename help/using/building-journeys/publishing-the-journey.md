When the journey is published, it is in **read-only** mode. When a journey is read-only, you can only modify the activity labels and descriptions, the journey's name and the journey's description. If you need to make more modifications to a published journey, create [a new version](journey-ui.md#journey-versions) of your journey. 

When you stop a journey, it is permanently stopped: all the persons flowing in the journey are permanently stopped, and the journey stops allowing new entrances. If you need to run the journey again, you must duplicate it and publish the new journey.

>If changes are made to an offer decision which is being used in a journey's message, you need to unpublish the journey and republish it.  This will ensure that the changes are incorporated into the journey's message and that the message is consistent with the latest updates.

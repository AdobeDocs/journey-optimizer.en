# Get started with journeys{#jo-general-principle}

Use [!DNL Journey Optimizer] to build real-time orchestration use cases using contextual data stored in events or data sources.

Design multistep advanced scenarios powered by following capabilities:

* Send real-time **unitary delivery** triggered when an event is received, or **in batch** using Adobe Experience Platform segments.

* Leverage **contextual data** from events, information from Adobe Experience Platform, or data from third-party API services.

* Use the **built-in actions** to send messages designed in [!DNL Journey Optimizer] or create **custom actions** if you're using a third-party system to send your messages.

* With the **journey designer**, build your multistep use cases: easily drag and drop an entry event or a read segment activity, add conditions and send personalized messages.

## Steps to create a journey{#steps-journey}

Use Adobe Journey Optimizer to design and orchestrate personalized journeys from a single canvas.

Adobe Journey Optimizer includes an omnichannel orchestration canvas which allows marketers to harmonize marketing outreach with one-to-one customer engagement. The user interface allows you to easily drag and drop activities from the palette into the canvas to build your journey.

## Journey versions{#journey-versions}

In the journey list, all journey versions are displayed with the version number. See [this page](../building-journeys/using-the-journey-designer.md). 

When you search for a journey, newest versions appear at the top of the list the first time the application opens. Then, you can define the sorting you want and the application will keep it as a user preference. The journey's version is also displayed at the top of the journey edition interface, above the canvas.

>[!NOTE]

>Usually, a profile cannot be present multiple times in the same journey, at the same time. If re-entrance is enabled, a profile can reenter a journey, but cannot do it until he fully exited that previous instance of the journey. [Read more](end-journey.md).

If you need to modify to a live journey, create a new version of your journey.

1. Open the latest version of your live journey, click **[!UICONTROL Create a new version]** and confirm.

    >[!NOTE]

    >You can only create a new version from the latest version of a journey.

1. Make your modifications, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]** and confirm.

From the moment the journey is published, individuals will start to flow into the latest version of the journey. People who have already entered a previous version stay in it until they finish the journey. If they later re-enter the same journey, they will go into the latest version.

Journey versions can be stopped individually. All versions of journeys have the same name.

When you publish a new version of a journey, the previous version automatically ends and switches to the **Closed** status. No entrance in the journey can happen. Even if you stop the latest version, the previous version stays closed.

# Update Profile {#update-profile}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="ajo_journey_update_profiles"
>title="Update Profile activity"
>abstract="The Update Profile action activity allows you to update an existing Adobe Experience Platform profile with information coming from the event, a datasource or using a specific value."

Use the **[!UICONTROL Update Profile]** action activity to update an existing Adobe Experience Platform profile with information coming from an event, a datasource or with a specific value.

## Recommendations

* The **Update Profile** action can only be used in journeys starting with an event that has a namespace.
* The action only updates existing fields, it does not create new profile fields.
* You cannot use the **Update Profile** action to generate experience events, for example a purchase.
* Just like any other action, you can define an alternative path in case of error or timeout, and you cannot place two actions in parallel.
* The update request sent to Adobe Experience Platform is immediate/within a second. It will take normally a few seconds but sometimes more with no guarantee. As a result, for example, if an action is using "field 1" updated by an **Update Profile** action positioned right before, you should not expect that "field 1" will be updated in the action.
* The **Update profile** activity does not support XDM fields that are defined as an enumeration.

## Using the profile update

1. Design your journey by starting with an event. See this [section](../building-journeys/journey.md).

1. In the **Action** section of the palette, drop the **Update Profile** activity into the canvas.

1. Select a schema from the list.

1. Click on **Field** to select the field you want to update. Only one field can be selected.

1. Select a dataset from the list. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The **Update Profile** action updates the profile data in realtime, but it does not update datasets. The dataset selection is needed as the profile is a record related to a dataset.

1. Click on the **Value** field to define the value you want to use:

   * Using the simple expression editor, you can select a field from a data source or from the incoming event.

   * If you want to define a specific value or leverage advanced functions, click on **Advanced mode**.

The **Update Profile** is now configured.

## Using the test mode {#using-the-test-mode}

In test mode, the profile update will not be simulated. The update will be performed on the test profile. 

Only test profiles can enter a journey in test mode. You can either create a new test profile or turn an existing profile into a test profile. In Adobe Experience Platform, you can update profiles attributes via a csv file import or API calls. A simpler method is to use an **Update Profile** action activity and change the test profile boolean field from false to true.

For more information on the how to turn an existing profile into a test profile, refer to this [section](../segment/creating-test-profiles.md#create-test-profiles-csv).

# Integrate with Intelligent Services {#ai-overview}

The integration with Intelligent Services allows you to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning in customer experience use cases. This allows for marketing analysts to set up predictions specific to a company's needs using business-level configurations without the need for data science expertise.

For more information on Intelligent Services, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/intelligent-services/home.html).  

This integration allows you to leverage customer predictions.

Customer AI is part of Intelligent Services. It helps predict what a customer is likely to do. See the [documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/intelligent-services/customer-ai/overview.html).  

Customer AI allows brands to create churn or conversion machine learning based scores that will be available as profile attributes in the Adobe Experience Platform profiles (Real-time Customer Profile).

As a result, they can be used as any other profile attributes in Journey Optimizer's conditions (to make the best decisions), actions or segment building.

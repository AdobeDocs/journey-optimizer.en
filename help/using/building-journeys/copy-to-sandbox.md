Journey Optimizer allows you to copy an entire journey from one sandbox to another. For example, you can copy a journey from your Stage sandbox environment to your Production sandbox.

In addition to the journey itself, Journey Optimizer also copies most of the objects the journey depends on: audiences, schemas, events and actions.

The copy process is carried via a **package export and import** between the source and target sandboxes. Detailed information on how to export objects and import them into a target sandbox are available in this section: [Copy objects to another sandbox](../configuration/copy-objects-to-sandbox.md)

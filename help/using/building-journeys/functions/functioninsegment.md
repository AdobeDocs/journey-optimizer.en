# inSegment {#inSegment}

Checks if an individual belongs to a given audience.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can retrieve up to 100 audiences.

The audience name must be a string constant. It cannot be a field reference nor an expression.

Audiences are defined in the [Adobe Experience Platform](https://platform.adobe.com/audience/overview). The expression editor provides an autocompleted list of audiences.

Audiences can have three statuses:

* existing: entity continues to be in the audience.
* realized: entity is entering the audience.
* exited: entity is exiting the audience.

Only the individuals with the **Realized** and **Existing** audience participation statuses will be considered as members of the audience. For more on how to evaluate an audience, refer to the [Segmentation Service documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/tutorials/evaluate-a-segment.html?lang=en#interpret-segment-results). 

`IF inSegment('segmentName') == true` means that you have a segmentMembership with the entered/existing status.

`ELSE inSegment('segmentName') == false` means that you have a segmentMembership of the exited status.

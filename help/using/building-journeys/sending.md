# Journey execution {#message-execution}

## Test your journey

You can test your journey using test profiles. This step is recommended to validate your settings and messages.

Learn more in this [section](testing-the-journey.md).

## Activate your journey

You must publish your journey to activate it.

Once published, you can monitor your journey using the dedicated reporting tools to measure your journey's effectiveness.

## Send messages {#send-messages}

When your message has a content defined, it is ready to be sent through a [journey](journey.md).

Once a message is sent, you can monitor its execution through multiple indicators. [Learn more about Reporting](../global-report.md).

## Schedule messages {#schedule-messages}

Messages can be scheduled through the **[!UICONTROL Read Segment]** activity in a [journey](journey.md). You can specify when the segment will enter the journey. [Learn more about the Read Segment activity](read-segment.md).

To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Edit a journey, drag and drop a **[!UICONTROL Read Segment]** activity and start configuring it. [Learn more about configuring the Read Segment activity](read-segment.md#configuring-segment-trigger-activity).

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Edit journey schedule]** link to access the journey's properties.

1. Configure the **[!UICONTROL Scheduler type]** field: select the desired value from the list to make the segment enter the journey on a specific date/time, or on a recurring basis.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The **[!UICONTROL Schedule]** section is only available when a **[!UICONTROL Read Segment]** activity has been dropped into the canvas.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >By default, segments enter the journey **[!UICONTROL As soon as possible]**, meaning 1 hour after the journey is published.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]** to save your changes.

<!--Unitary messages that are triggered by an event within a journey cannot be scheduled.-->

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] message capabilities are built-in, you just need to design your content and publish your message. See [this section](../get-started-content.md). Then you simply add, in your journey, a push or email message designed using Journey Optimizer. 

If you're using a third-party system to send your messages, you can create a custom action. Learn more in this [section](../action/action.md).

## Adding a Message activity

1. As always, start your journey with an event or a **Read segment** activity.

## Channel parameters

The **Channel** parameters are displayed. These fields are read-only. This configuration is performed when creating the message. See [this section](../get-started-content.md).

You can use the **Enable editing field** icon on the right side of the field to force a specific value. This can be useful for testing purposes. For example, for an email, you can add your email address. When publishing the journey, the email will be sent to you.

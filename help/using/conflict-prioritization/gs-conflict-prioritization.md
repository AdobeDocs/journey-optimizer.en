In Journey Optimizer, managing the volume and timing of campaigns and journeys is essential to avoid overwhelming customers with too many interactions. Journey Optimizer offers several tools for conflict management and prioritization.

With the **conflict detection tool**, you can identify potential overlaps in journeys and campaigns. This is crucial as too many simultaneous communications can lead to customer fatigue. Journey Optimizer allows you to monitor elements such as timelines, audience overlap, and channel configurations. By identifying conflicts early, you can refine your campaigns to avoid bombarding customers with multiple messages at the same time.

Additionally, **priority scores** help you control which campaigns or journeys take precedence when a customer qualifies for multiple communications. This is especially useful for inbound channels such as web and mobile, where only one campaign can be shown at any given time. By assigning a priority score to each journey or campaign, you can ensure that the most important message is delivered first.

**Journey capping & arbitration** allows you to limit how often and how many journeys a customer can enter within a certain time frame. You can set up rules to cap the number of journey entries for a profile or limit the number of journeys a customer can be enrolled in at the same time. Additionally, you can use arbitration settings to decide which journey a customer should enter if they qualify for multiple journeys, using priority scores to determine the best fit.

Finally, you can also use rule sets to set **frequency capping by communication type** (e.g., Sales, Promotional) to prevent overloading customers with similar messages. You can control frequency across multiple channels, automatically excluding over-solicited profiles to ensure a better customer experience.

By leveraging these features, you can ensure smoother and more targeted marketing efforts, delivering the right message at the right time while avoiding conflicts and overload.

# Access delegated subdomains

All your delegated subdomains display in the **[!UICONTROL Message Configuration]** / **[!UICONTROL Subdomain delegation]** menu.

Several filters are available to help you refine the list (delegation date, user or status).

The Status column provides information on the subdomain delegation process:

* **[!UICONTROL Draft]**: the subdomain delegation has been saved as a draft. Click on the line to resume the subdomain delegation.

* **[!UICONTROL Processing]**: the subdomain is going through several configuration checks before it can be used.

* **[!UICONTROL Success]** (!!or Verified?): the subdomain has gone through the checks successfully and can be used to deliver messages.

* **[!UICONTROL Failed]**: one or several checks have failed after the subdomain delegation was submitted.

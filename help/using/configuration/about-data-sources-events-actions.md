# Configure journeys

In order to send messages with journeys, you need to configure **[!UICONTROL Data Sources]**, **[!UICONTROL Events]** and **[!UICONTROL Actions]**.

## Data Sources

The Data Source configuration allows you to define a connection to a system to retrieve additional information that will be used in your journeys. [Learn more](../../using/datasource/about-data-sources.md)

## Events 

Events allow you to trigger your journeys unitarily to send messages, in real-time, to the individual flowing into the journey.

In the event configuration, you configure the events expected in the journeys. The incoming eventsâ€™ data is normalized following the Adobe Experience Data Model (XDM). Events come from Streaming Ingestion APIs for authenticated and unauthenticated events (such as Adobe Mobile SDK events). [Learn more](../../using/event/about-events.md)
 
## Actions 

Journey Optimizer message capabilities are built-in: you only need to design your content and publish your message. If you are using a third-party system to send your messages, you can create a custom action. [Learn more](../../using/action/action.md)

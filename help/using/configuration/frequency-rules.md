# Configure business rules {#frequency-rules}

>abstract="Message frequency rules are a type of business rule that restrict the number of times users receive messages or enter into journeys across one or multiple channels. These cross-channel rules automatically exclude over-solicited profiles from messages and actions."

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to control how often users will receive a message or enter into a journey across one or multiple channel. Message frequency rules that automatically exclude over-solicited profiles from messages and actions.

For example, for a brand, a rule could be not to send more than 4 marketing messages per month to their customers. To do this, you can use a business rule which will cap the number of messages sent based on one or more channels during a monthly calendar period.

### Permissions{#permissions-frequency-rules}

To access, create, edit or delete business rules, you must have the **[!UICONTROL Manage frequency rules]** permission. 

Users with the **[!UICONTROL View frequency rules]** permission are able to view rules, but not to modify or delete them.

To create a new business rule, follow the steps below.

1. Access the **[!UICONTROL Business rules]** list, then click **[!UICONTROL Create rule]**.

    ![](assets/message-rules-create.png)

1. Define the rule name and select the message rule category.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Only the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category is available.

   ![](assets/message-rules-details.png)

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Duration]** drop-down list, select a time frame for the capping to be applied. [Learn more](#frequency-cap)

1. Set the capping for your rule, meaning the maximum number of messages that can be sent to an individual user profile each month, or week <!--or day--> - according to your selection above.

   <!--![](assets/message-rules-capping.png)-->

1. Select the channel you want to use for this rule: **[!UICONTROL Email]**, **[!UICONTROL Push notification]**, **[!UICONTROL SMS]** or **[!UICONTROL Direct mail]**.

   ![](assets/message-rules-channels.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You must select at least one channel to be able to create the rule.

1. Select several channels if you want to apply capping across all selected channels as a total count.

   For example, set capping to 15, and select both the email and push channels. If a profile has already received 10 marketing emails and 5 marketing push notifications for the selected period, this profile will be excluded from the very next delivery of any marketing email or push notification.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save as draft]** to confirm the rule creation. Your message is added to the rule list, with the **[!UICONTROL Draft]** status.

   ![](assets/message-rules-created.png)

### Frequency cap {#frequency-cap}

From the **[!UICONTROL Duration]** drop-down list, select if you want the capping to be applied monthly or weekly.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Daily frequency cap is also available on demand. [Learn more](#daily-frequency-cap)

Frequency cap is based on the selected calendar period. It is reset at the beginning of the corresponding time frame.

![](assets/message-rules-capping-duration.png)

The expiry of the counter for each period is as follows:

* **[!UICONTROL Monthly]**: The frequency cap is valid until the last day of the month at 23:59:59 UTC. For example, the monthly expiration for January is 01-31 23:59:59 UTC.

* **[!UICONTROL Weekly]**: The frequency cap is valid until Saturday 23:59:59 UTC of that week as the calendar week starts on Sunday. The expiry is irrespective of the rule creation. For example, if the rule is created on Thursday, this rule is valid until Saturday at 23:59:59.

### Daily frequency cap {#daily-frequency-cap}

In addition to montly and weekly, daily frequency cap is also available on demand. For more on this, contact your Adobe representative.

The daily frequency cap is valid for the day until 23:59:59 UTC and resets to 0 at the start of the next day.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To ensure accuracy for daily frequency capping rules, the use of [streaming segmentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/ui/streaming-segmentation.html){target="_blank"} is recommended. Learn more on audience evaluation methods in [this section](../audience/about-audiences.md#evaluation-method-in-journey-optimizer).

## Activate a business rule {#activate-rule}

When created, a business rule has the **[!UICONTROL Draft]** status and is not yet impacting any message. To enable it, click the ellipsis next to the rule and select **[!UICONTROL Activate]**.

   ![](assets/message-rules-activate.png)

Activating a rule will impact any messages it applies to on their next execution. Learn how to [apply a business rule to a message](#apply-frequency-rule).

>[!NOTE]
>
>It can take up to 10 minutes for a rule to be fully activated. You do not need to modify messages or republish journeys for a rule to take effect.

To deactivate a business rule, click the ellipsis next to the rule and select **[!UICONTROL Deactivate]**.

![](assets/message-rules-deactivate.png)
   
The rule's status will change to **[!UICONTROL Inactive]** and the rule will not apply to future message executions. Any messages currently in execution will not be affected.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Deactivating a rule does not affect or reset any counts on individual profiles.

## Apply a business rule to a message {#apply-frequency-rule}
 
To apply a business rule to a message, follow the steps below.

1. When creating a [journey](../building-journeys/journey-gs.md), add a message by selecting one of the channels you defined for your rule.

1. Select the category you defined for the [rule you created](#create-new-rule).

   ![](assets/journey-message-category.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Currently only the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category is available for business rules.

1. You can click the **[!UICONTROL Frequency rule]** link to view the frequency rules screen in a new tab. [Learn more](#access-rules)

   All the rules matching the selected category and channel(s) will be automatically applied to this message.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Messages where the category selected is **[!UICONTROL Transactional]** will not be evaluated against frequency rules.

1. You can view the number of profiles excluded from delivery in the [Customer Journey Analytics report](../reports/report-gs-cja.md), and in the [Live report](../reports/live-report.md), where business rules will be listed as a possible reason for users excluded from delivery.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Several rules can apply to the same channel, but once the lower cap is reached, the profile will be excluded from the next deliveries.

## Example: combine several rules {#frequency-rule-example}

You can combine several business rules, such as described in the example below.

1. [Create a business rule](#create-new-rule) called *Overall Marketing Capping*:

   * Select all channels.
   * Set capping to 12 monthly.

   ![](assets/message-rules-ex-overall-cap.png)

1. To further restrict the number of marketing-based push notifications that a user is sent, create a second rule called *Push Marketing Cap*:

   * Select Push channel.
   * Set capping to 4 monthly.

   ![](assets/message-rules-ex-push-cap.png)

1. Save and [activate](#activate-rule) the rule.

1. [Create a message](../building-journeys/journeys-message.md) for every channel you want to communicate through and select the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category for each message. [Learn how to apply a business rule](#apply-frequency-rule)

<!--
Learn how to create a message for the different channels in the following sections:
* [Create an email](../email/create-email.md)
* [Create a push notification](../push/create-push.md)
* [Create an SMS](../sms/create-sms.md)
* [Create a direct mail](../direct-mail/create-direct-mail.md)

Create an email and select the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category for that message. [Learn more](../email/create-email.md)

Create a push notification and select the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category for that message. [Learn more](../push/create-push.md)

Create an SMS and select the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category for that message. [Learn more](../sms/create-sms.md)

Create a direct mail and select the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category for that message. [Learn more](../direct-mail/create-direct-mail.md)
-->

In this scenario, an individual profile:
* can receive up to 12 marketing messages per month;
* but will be excluded from marketing push notifications after they have received 4 push notifications.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When testing business rules, it is recommended to use a newly created [test profile](../audience/creating-test-profiles.md), because once a profile's frequency cap is reached, there is no way to reset the counter until the next month. Deactivating a rule will allow capped profiles to receive messages, but it will not remove or delete any counter increments.

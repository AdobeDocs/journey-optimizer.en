# Create message presets

With [!DNL Journey Optimizer], you can set up message presets that define all the technical parameters required for email and push notification message: email type, sender email and name, mobile apps, and more. 

>[!CAUTION]
>
> * Message presets configuration is restricted to Journey Administrators. [Learn more](../administration/ootb-product-profiles.md#journey-administrator)
>
> * You must perform Email configuration and [Push configuration](../push-configuration.md) steps before creating message presets.

Once message presets have been configured, you be able to select them when creating messages from the **[!UICONTROL Presets]** list.

## Create a message preset {#create-message-preset}

To create a message preset, follow these steps:

1. Access the **[!UICONTROL Channels]** > **[!UICONTROL Branding]** > **[!UICONTROL Message presets]** menu, then click **[!UICONTROL Create Message preset]**.

    ![](../assets/preset-create.png)

1. Enter a name and a description (optional) for the preset, then select the channel(s) to configure.

    ![](../assets/preset-general.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Names must begin with a letter (A-Z). It can only contain alpha-numeric characters. You can also use underscore `_`, dot`.` and hyphen `-` characters. 

1. Configure the **email** settings.

    ![](../assets/preset-email.png)

    * Select the type of message that will be sent with the preset: **Transactional** or **Marketing**

        >[!CAUTION]
        >
        > **Transactional** messages can be sent to profiles who unsubscribed from marketing communications. These messages can only be sent in specific contexts, such as password reset, order status, delivery notification for example.
        >
    
    * Select the subdomain to use to send the emails. [Learn more](about-subdomain-delegation.md)
    * Select the IP pool to associate with the preset. [Learn more](ip-pools.md)
    * Enter the header parameters for the emails sent using that preset.

        >[!CAUTION]
        >
        >Except for the **Reply to (forward email)** field, email addresses domain must use the current selected [delegated subdomain](about-subdomain-delegation.md).

        * **[!UICONTROL Sender name]**: Name of the sender, such as your brand's name.

        * **[!UICONTROL Sender email]**: The email address you want to use for your communications. For example, if the delegated subdomain is *marketing.luma.com*, you can use *contact@marketing.luma.com*.

        * **[!UICONTROL Reply to (name)]**: The name that will be used when the recipient clicks the **Reply** button in their email client software.

        * **[!UICONTROL Reply to (email)]**: The email address that will be used when the recipient clicks the **Reply** button in their email client software. The emails sent to this address will be forwarded to the **[!UICONTROL Reply to (forward email)]** address provided below. You must use an address defined on the delegated subdomain (for example, *reply@marketing.luma.com*), otherwise the emails will be dropped.

        * **[!UICONTROL Error email]**: All errors generated by ISPs after a few days of mail being delivered (asynchronous bounces) are received on this address.

        ![](../assets/preset-header.png)

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >Names must begin with a letter (A-Z). It can only contain alpha-numeric characters. You can also use underscore `_`, dot`.` and hyphen `-` characters.

        <!--**[!UICONTROL Reply to (forward email)]**: All emails received by [!DNL Journey Optimizer] for the delegated subdomain will be forwarded to this email address. You can specify any address, except an email address defined on the delegated subdomain. For example, if the delegated subdomain is *marketing.luma.com*, any address like *abc@marketing.luma.com* is prohibited.-->

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >From the October 2021 release, it is not possible anymore to define a forward email addresse from the [!DNL Journey Optimizer] user interface. If you want all emails received by [!DNL Journey Optimizer] for the delegated subdomain to be forwarded to a specific  email address, contact the [Adobe Customer Care Support Team](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/support-for-experience-cloud.ug.html){target="_blank"}. <!--move to Deprecated features section when created?-->

    * Configure the **email retry parameters**. By default, the [retry time period](retries.md#retry-duration) is set to 84 hours, but you can adjust this setting to better suit your needs.

        ![](../assets/preset-retry-paramaters.png)

        You must enter an integer value (in hours or minutes) within the following range:
        * For marketing email type, the minimum retry period is 6 hours.
        * For transactional email type, the minimum retry period is 10 minutes.
        * For both email types, the maximum retry period is 84 hours (or 5040 minutes).

1. Configure the **push notification** settings.

     ![](../assets/preset-push.png)
   
    * Select at least one platform: **iOS** and/or **Android**
    
    * Select the mobile applications to use for each platform. 
        
      For more on how to configure your environment to send push notifications, refer to [this section](../push-gs.md).

1. Once all the parameters have been configured, click **[!UICONTROL Submit]** to confirm. You can also save the message preset as draft and resume its configuration later on.

    ![](../assets/preset-submit.png)
    
1. Once the message preset has been created, it displays in the list with the **[!UICONTROL Processing]** status.

    During this step, several checks will be performed to verify that it has been configured properly. The processing time is around **48h-72h**, and can take up to **7-10 days**.

    These checks include deliverability tests that are performed by Adobe deliverability team:

    * SPF validation
    * DKIM validation
    * MX record validation
    * Check IPs denylisting
    * Helo host check
    * IP pool verification
    * A/PTR record, t/m/res subdomain verification

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >If the checks are not successful, learn more on the possible failure reasons in [this section](#monitor-message-presets).  

1. Once the checks are successful, the message preset gets the **[!UICONTROL Active]** status. It is ready to be used to deliver messages.

    <!-- later on, users will be notified in Pulse -->

    ![](../assets/preset-active.png)

## Monitor message presets {#monitor-message-presets}

All your message presets display in the **[!UICONTROL Channels]** > **[!UICONTROL Message presets]** menu. Filters are available to help you browse through the list (channel type, user, status).

![](../assets/preset-filters.png)

Message presets can have the following statuses:

* **[!UICONTROL Draft]**: The message preset has been saved as a draft and has not been submitted yet. Open it to resume the configuration.
* **[!UICONTROL Processing]**: The message preset has been submitted and is going through several verifications steps.
* **[!UICONTROL Active]**: The message preset has been verified and can be selected to create messages.
* **[!UICONTROL Failed]**: One or several checks have failed during the message preset verification.
* **[!UICONTROL Deactivated]**: The message preset is deactivated. It cannot be used to create new messages.

In case a message preset creation fails, the details on each possible failure reason are described below.

If one of these errors occurs, contact the [Adobe Customer Care Support Team](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/support-for-experience-cloud.ug.html){target="_blank"} to get assistance.

* **SPF validation failed**: SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is an email authentication protocol that allows to specify authorized IPs that can send emails from a given subdomain. SPF validation failure means that the IP addresses in the SPF record do not match the IP addresses used for sending emails to the mailbox providers. 

* **DKIM validation failed**: DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) allows the recipient server to verify that the received message was sent by the genuine sender of the associated domain and that the content of the original message was not altered on its way. DKIM validation failure means that the receiving mail servers are unable to verify the authenticity of the message content and its association with the sending domain.:

* **MX record validation failed**: MX (Mail eXchange) record validation failure means that the mail servers responsible for accepting inbound emails on behalf of a given subdomain are not correctly configured.

* **Deliverability configurations failed**: Deliverability configurations failure can happen due to any of the following reasons:
    * Blocklisting of the allocated IPs
    * Invalid `helo` name
    * Emails being sent from IPs other than the ones specified in the IP pool of the corresponding preset
    * Unable to deliver emails to inboxes of major ISPs like Gmail and Yahoo

## Edit a message preset {#edit-message-preset}

To edit a message preset, follow the steps below.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can update most of the settings in a message preset, except the **[!UICONTROL Push notification settings]** fields which are not editable.

1. From the list, click a message preset name to open it.

    ![](../assets/preset-name.png)

1. Edit its properties as desired.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >If a message preset has the **[!UICONTROL Active]** status, the **[!UICONTROL Name]**, **[!UICONTROL Select channel]** and **[!UICONTROL Subdomain]** fields are greyed out and cannot be edited.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Submit]** to confirm your changes.

    ![](../assets/preset-confirm-update.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >You can also save the message preset as draft and resume update later on.

Once the changes are submitted, the message preset will go through the same validation cycle as during the [creation step](#create-message-preset).

<!--To check the message preset update details, click the **[!UICONTROL More actions]** button and select **[!UICONTROL Recent updates]**. (TBC)

You can also access the update details from a message preset while update is in progress.(TBC)

You can see information such as the update status, the approximate remaining time before completion (if validation is in progress), and the list of requested changes. (TBC)-->

### Update statuses

A message preset update can have the following statuses:

* **[!UICONTROL Processing]**: The message preset update has been submitted and is going through several verifications steps.
* **[!UICONTROL Success]**: The updated message preset has been verified and can be selected to create messages.
* **[!UICONTROL Failed]**: One or several checks have failed during the message preset update verification.

**Processing**

Several deliverability checks will be performed to verify that the preset has been updated properly. The processing time is around **48h-72h**, and can take up to **7-10 days**. Learn more on the checks performed during the validation cycle in [this section](#create-message-preset).

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot modify a message preset while update is in progress. You can still click its name, but all the fields are greyed out. The changes will not be reflected until the update is successful.

If you edit a preset that was already active:
* Its status remains **[!UICONTROL Active]** while the validation process is in progress.

    <!--* The **[!UICONTROL Updating]** icon displays next to the name of the preset in the message presets list.-->

* During the validation process, the messages configured using this preset are still using the older version of the preset.

**Success**

Once the validation process is successful, the new version of the preset is automatically used in all messages using this preset. However, you may have to wait:
* a few minutes before it is consumed by the unitary messages,
* until the next batch for the preset to be effective in batch messages.

<!--Changes made to a message preset with the **[!UICONTROL Active]** status will automatically be applied to all messages currently using this preset.-->

**Failed**

If the validation process fails, the older version of the preset will still be used.

When the update fails, the preset becomes editable again. You can then click its name and update the settings that need to be fixed. <!--Learn more on the possible failure reasons in [this section](#monitor-message-presets).-->

The possible update error types are as follows:
* **Authorization error**: the bearer token is invalid or not authorized.
* **Illegal modification**: an edit was performed on one or more non-allowed fields.
* **Precondition failed**: some fields can only have specific values and this has not been honored.

## Deactivate a message preset

To make an active message preset unavailable to create new messages, you can deactivate it. However, the published messages using this preset will not be affected and will continue working.

1. Access the message presets list.

1. For the active preset of your choice, click the **[!UICONTROL More actions]** button.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Deactivate]**.

    ![](../assets/preset-deactivate.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Deactivated message presets cannot be deleted to avoid any issue in journeys using these presets to send messages.

You cannot directly edit a deactivated message preset. However, you can duplicate it and edit the copy to create a new version that you will use to create new messages:

1. Access the message presets list.

1. Deactivate the message preset that you want to edit.

1. Duplicate the deactivated message preset. A copy with the **[!UICONTROL Draft]** status is automatically added to the list.

    ![](../assets/preset-duplicated.png)

1. Open the duplicated message preset, modify it according to your needs, then submit your changes. The message preset will go through the same validation cycle as during the [creation step](#create-message-preset).

1. Once validated, it gets the **[!UICONTROL Active]** status and is ready to be used to create new messages.

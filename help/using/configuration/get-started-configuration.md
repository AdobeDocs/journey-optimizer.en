# Get started with [!DNL Journey Optimizer] configuration {#start-optimizer-configuration}

When accessing [!DNL Journey Optimizer] for the first time, you are provisioned a production sandbox and allocated a certain number of IPs depending on your contract.

To be able to create your journeys and send messages, you need to go though these configuration steps:

1. **Configure messages and channels**: define surfaces, adapt and customize email and push messages

    * Define push notifications settings in both [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] and [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch]. [Learn more](../configuration/push-gs.md)

    * Create message surfaces to configure all the technical parameters required for email and push notification messages. [Learn more](message-presets.md)

    * Determine which email address to use in priority for your recipients when several addresses are available in Adobe Experience Platform. [Learn more](primary-email-addresses.md)

    * Manage the number of days during which retries are performed before sending email addresses to the suppression list. [Learn more](manage-suppression-list.md)

    <!--
    * Understand push notification flow. [Learn more](../configuration/push-gs.md)
    -->
    
1. **Delegate subdomains**: for any new subdomain to be used in Journey Optimizer, the first step will be to delegate it. [Learn more](about-subdomain-delegation.md)

1. **Create IP pools**: improve your email deliverability and reputation by grouping together IP addresses provisioned with your instance. [Learn more](ip-pools.md)

1. **Configure journeys**: in order to build journeys, you need to configure **[!UICONTROL Data Sources]**, **[!UICONTROL Events]** and **[!UICONTROL Actions]**. [Learn more](about-data-sources-events-actions.md)

    * The **Data Source** configuration allows you to define a connection to a system to retrieve additional information that will be used in your journeys. Learn more about Data Sources in this [section](../datasource/about-data-sources.md)

    * **Events** allow you to trigger your journeys unitarily to send messages, in real-time, to the individual flowing into the journey. In the event configuration, you configure the events expected in the journeys. The incoming eventsâ€™ data is normalized following the Adobe Experience Data Model (XDM). Events come from Streaming Ingestion APIs for authenticated and unauthenticated events (such as Adobe Mobile SDK events). Learn more about events in this [section](../event/about-events.md)
    
    * [!DNL Journey Optimizer] comes with built-in message capabilities: you can design your content and publish your message. If you are using a third-party system to send your messages, create a **custom action**. Learn more about actions in this [section](../action/action.md)

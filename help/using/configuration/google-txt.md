TXT records are a type of DNS records used to provide text information about a domain, that can be read by external sources.

In order to ensure optimal deliverability and successful delivery of emails to Gmail addresses, [!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to add special Google site verification TXT records to your subdomain to make sure that it is verified.

>[!CAUTION]
>
> This operation can only be performed once a subdomain has the **[!UICONTROL Success]** status. For more on subdomains' statuses, refer to [this section](access-subdomains.md).

To add a Google TXT record to your subdomain, follow these steps:

1. Open the subdomain from the **[!UICONTROL Channels]** / **[!UICONTROL Subdomains]** menu.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Google txt record]** section, enter the verification code generated from [Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/answer/183895){target="_blank"}<!--G Suite Admin tools-->, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

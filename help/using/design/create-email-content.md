The Email Designer allows you to easily define the structure of your email. By adding and moving structural elements with simple drag-and-drop actions, you can design the shape of your email within seconds.

To start building your email content with the email designer, follow the steps below:

1. From the Email Designer home page, select the **[!UICONTROL Design from scratch]** option.

1. Start designing your email content by drag and dropping **[!UICONTROL Structure components]** to define the layout of your email.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Note that stack of columns are not compatible with all email programs. When not supported, columns will not be stacked.
   >
   >Once placed in the email, you cannot move nor remove your components unless there is already a content component or a fragment placed inside.

1. Add as many **[!UICONTROL Structure components]** as needed.

   Select the **[!UICONTROL n:n column]** component to define the number of columns of your choice (between 3 and 10). You can also define the width of each column by moving the arrows at the bottom of each column.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Each column size cannot be under 10% of the total width of the structure component. You cannot remove a column that is not empty.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Content components]** drop-down, you can add as many **[!UICONTROL Content components]** as you need in your structure component. [Learn more about Content components](content-components.md).

1. Each component can be further customized with the **[!UICONTROL Component settings]** section. For example, you can change your text style, the padding or margin of your component. [Learn more about alignment and padding](adjusting-vertical-alignment-and-padding.md).

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Assets picker]**, you can directly add assets stored in the **[!UICONTROL Assets library]** to your email. [Learn more about asset management](assets-essentials.md).

    Double-click the folder which contained your assets and drag and drop the asset you want to add to your email.

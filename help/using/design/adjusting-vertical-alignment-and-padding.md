# Adjust vertical alignment and padding {#adjusting-vertical-alignment-and-padding}

In this example, we will adjust padding and vertical alignment inside a structure component composed of three columns.

1. Select the structure component directly in the email or using the **[!UICONTROL Navigation tree]** available in the left-hand menu.

1. From the toolbar, click **[!UICONTROL Select a column]** and choose the one that you want to edit. You can also select it from the structure tree.

   The editable parameters for that column are displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Column settings]** menu.

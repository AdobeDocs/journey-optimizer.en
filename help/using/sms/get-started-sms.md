# Get started with SMS {#get-started-sms}

Use [!DNL Journey Optimizer] to send text messages to your customers on their mobile devices. You can create, personalize, and preview messages in text format from the SMS editor.

SMS deliveries can be created:

* In a **Journey**: Once you added an SMS activity in your journey, and defined basic settings, use the **[!UICONTROL Actions: SMS]** right pane to create the content for the SMS message. 

    For more information on how to configure your journey, refer to this [page](../building-journeys/journey-gs.md).

* In a **Campaign**: Once you created a campaign, select SMS as your action and define basic settings. 

    For more information on how to configure your campaign, refer to this [page](../campaigns/create-campaign.md#configure).


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If this is your first time creating an SMS, make sure the SMS channel has been configured. [Learn more](sms-configuration.md).

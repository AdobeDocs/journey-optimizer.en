# Create an MMS message {#create-mms}

## Prerequisites{#sms-prerequisites}

Before creating your SMS message, you first need to configure your SMS vendor with Journey Optimizer, follow these steps:

* Before sending SMS, you must integrate the provider settings with Journey Optimizer.

    +++ Learn how to create a new Sinch MMS API credential.

    1. Configure your SMS API credentials:

    * For **[!DNL Sinch MMS]**:

        * **[!UICONTROL Name]**: choose a name for your API Credential.

        * **[!UICONTROL Project ID]**, **[!UICONTROL App ID]** and **[!UICONTROL API Token]**: from the Conversation API menu, you can find your credentials in the App menu.  [Learn more](https://docs.cc.sinch.com/cloud/service-configuration/en/oxy_ex-1/common/wln1620131604643.html)

        ![](assets/mms_provider.png)

    1. Click **[!UICONTROL Submit]** when you finished the configuration of your API credentials.

    After creating and configuring your API credential, you now need to create a channel surface (i.e. message preset) for SMS messages.

    +++

* Once done, you will need to create an SMS surface. These steps must be performed by an Adobe Journey Optimizer system administrator.

    +++ Learn how to create your channel surface.

    1. In the left rail, browse to **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Channels]** and select **[!UICONTROL Branding]** > **[!UICONTROL Channel surfaces]**. Click the **[!UICONTROL Create channel surface]** button.

        ![](assets/preset-create.png)

    1. Enter a name and a description (optional) for the surface, then select the SMS channel.

        ![](assets/sms-create-surface.png)

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        > Names must begin with a letter (A-Z). It can only contain alpha-numeric characters. You can also use underscore `_`, dot`.` and hyphen `-` characters.

    1. Define the **SMS settings**.

        ![](assets/sms-surface-settings.png)

        Start by selecting the **[!UICONTROL SMS Type]** that will be sent with the surface: **[!UICONTROL Transactional]** or **[!UICONTROL Marketing]**.

        * Choose **Marketing** for promotional SMS: these messages require user consent.
        * Choose **Transactional** for non-commercial messages such as order confirmation, password reset notifications, or delivery information for example.

        When creating a SMS message, you must choose a valid channel surface matching the category you selected for your message.

        >[!CAUTION]
        >
        >**Transactional** SMS messages can be sent to profiles who unsubscribed from marketing communications. These messages can only be sent in specific contexts.
    
    1. Select the **[!UICONTROL SMS configuration]** to associate with the surface.
        
        For more on how to configure your environment to send SMS messages, refer to [this section](#create-api).

    1. Enter the **[!UICONTROL Sender number]** â€‹you want to use for your communications.

    1. Select your **[!UICONTROL SMS Execution Field]** to select the **[!UICONTROL Profile attribute]** associated with the profiles' phone numbers.

    1. If you want to use the URL shortening function in your SMS messages, select an item from the **[!UICONTROL Subdomain]** list.

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >To be able to select a subdomain, make sure you have previously configured at least one SMS subdomain. [Learn how](sms-subdomains.md)

    1. Enter the **[!UICONTROL Opt-out number]** you want to use for this surface. When profiles opt out from this number, you are still able to send them messages from other numbers you may be using to send out SMS messages with [!DNL Journey Optimizer].

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >In [!DNL Journey Optimizer], SMS opt-out is no longer managed at the channel level. It is now specific to a number.

    1. Once all the parameters have been configured, click **[!UICONTROL Submit]** to confirm. You can also save the channel surface as draft and resume its configuration later on.

        ![](assets/sms-submit-surface.png)

    1. Once the channel surface has been created, it displays in the list with the **[!UICONTROL Processing]** status.

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >If the checks are not successful, learn more on the possible failure reasons in [this section](#monitor-channel-surfaces).  

    1. Once the checks are successful, the channel surface gets the **[!UICONTROL Active]** status. It is ready to be used to deliver messages.

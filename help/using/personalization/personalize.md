## Build personalization expressions using a dedicated syntax {#syntax}

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] uses an **inline** simple personalization syntax based on Handlebars which allows you to create expressions with contents enclosed by double curly braces **{{}}**. You can add multiple expressions in the same content or field without restrictions. [Learn more on the personalization syntax](personalization-syntax.md).

**Examples:**

* `Hello {{profile.person.name.firstName}} {{profile.person.name.lastName}}`
* `Hello {{profile.person.name.fullName}}`

When processing the message (email and push), Journey Optimizer replaces the expression with the data contained in the Experience Platform database:  `Hello {{profile.person.name.firstName}} {{profile.person.name.lastName}}` becomes "Hello John Doe".

## Leverage profile data to personalize your messages {#data}

The personalization is based on the profile data that are managed by the **XDM Individual Profile** schema defined in Adobe Experience Platform. Learn more in [Adobe Experience Platform Data Model (XDM) documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html){target="_blank"}.

>[!CAUTION]
>The **XDM Individual Profile** schema is the only schema you can use to personalize content in [!DNL Journey Optimizer].

In addition, you can also leverage **computed attributes** to personalize your content. Computed attributes are based on Profile-enabled Experience Event datasets ingested into Adobe Experience Platform and serve as aggregated data points stored within customer profiles that summarize individual behavioral events [Learn how to work with computed attributes](../audience/computed-attributes.md)

## Work with the personalization editor {#editor}

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] provides an personalization editor where you will select, arrange, customize and validate all the data to create a customized personalization for your content. Several tools are available to help build your personalization content, such as: felper functions, pre-defined expressions library, attributes favouriting, and more.

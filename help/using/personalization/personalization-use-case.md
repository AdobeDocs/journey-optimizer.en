# Personalization use case: order status notification {#personalization-use-case}

In this use case, you will see how to use multiple types of personalization in a single push notification message. Three types of personalization will be used:

* **Profile**: message personalization based on a profile field
* **Offer decision**: personalization based on decision management variables
* **Context**: personalization based on contextual data from the journey

The goal of this example is to push an event to [!DNL Journey Optimizer] every time a customer order is updated. A push notification is then sent to the customer with information on the order and a personalized offer.

For this use case, the following prerequisites are needed:

* configure an order event including the order number, status and item name. Refer to this [section](../event/about-events.md).
* create a decision, refer to this [section](../offers/offer-activities/create-offer-activities.md).

## Step 1 - Create the journey {#create-journey}

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Journeys]** menu and create a new journey.

1. Select the **Contextual attributes** menu. Contextual attributes are only available if a journey has passed contextual data to the message. Click **Journey Orchestration**. The following contextual information appears:

   * **Events**: this category regroups all fields from the event(s) placed before the channel action activity in the journey.
   * **Journey Properties**: the technical fields related to the journey for a given profile, for example the journey ID or the specific errors encountered. Learn more in [Journey Orchestration documentation](../building-journeys/expression/journey-properties.md).

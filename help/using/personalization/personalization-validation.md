# Personalization validation {#personalization-validation}

## Common errors

* **Path "XYZ" not found**

When trying to reference a field that is not defined in the schema.

In this case **firstName1** is not defined as attribute in the profile schema:

```

{{profile.person.name.firstName1}}

```

* **Type mismatch for variable "XYZ". Expected array. Found string.**

 When trying to iterate over a string instead of array:
 
 In this case **product** is not an array:

 ```
 {{each profile.person.name.firstName as |product|}}
  {{product.productName}}
 {{/each}}
 ```

* **Invalid handlebars syntax. Found `‘[XYZ}}’`**

 When invalid handlebars syntax is used.

  Handlebars expressions are surrounded with **{{expression}}**

 ```
    {{[profile.person.name.firstName}}
 ```

* **Invalid segment definition**

```
No segment definition found for 988afe9f0-d4ae-42c8-a0be-8d90e66e151
```

## Specific errors related to offers

The errors related to offers integration in an Email or Push message have the following pattern : 

```
Offer.<offerType>.[PlacementID].[ActivityID].<offer-attribute>
```

The validation is performed during the message publication or during personalization content validation in the Expression editor.

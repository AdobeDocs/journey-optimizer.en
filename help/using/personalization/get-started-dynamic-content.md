# Get started with dynamic content {#start-dynamic-content}

With Journey Optimizer, you can conditionally show different content based on profile attributes, contextual events or audience segments. This allows you to display different variants of a content depending on the profile's location, interests, purchases etc.

To do this, you need to create conditions in the conditions library, which allows you to design conditional rules and store them for further reuse across Journey Optimizer. 

Once conditions have been defined, you can leverage them across all channels by adding them into the Expression Editor or into email variants.

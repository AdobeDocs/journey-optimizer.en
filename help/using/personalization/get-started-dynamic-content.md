# Get started with dynamic content {#start-dynamic-content}

With Journey Optimizer, you can conditionally show different content in your messages based on profile attributes, contextual events or audience segments.

To do this, you need to create conditions in the conditions library, which allows you to design conditional rules and store them for further reuse across Journey Optimizer. 

Once conditions have been defined, you can leverage into expressions and email variants to create conditional content across all channe;s.

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] comes with built-in message capability. Custom actions enable you to configure connection of a third-party system to send messages or API calls. An action can be configured with any service from any provider that can be called through a REST API with a JSON-formatted payload.

* If you are using Adobe Campaign v7 or v8, an integration is available upon request. Refer to [this page](../action/acc-action.md).

* If you are using a third-party system to send messages such as Epsilon, Facebook, Adobe Developer, Firebase, etc, you need to create and configure a custom action. Refer to [this page](../action/about-custom-action-configuration.md).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The configuration of custom actions must be performed by a **technical user**.

Custom actions are additional actions defined by technical users and made available to marketers: once configured, they appear in the left palette of your journey, in the **[!UICONTROL Action]** category. Learn more in [this page](../building-journeys/about-journey-activities.md#action-activities). 

To view the action list or configure a new action, select **[!UICONTROL Configurations]** in the ADMINISTRATION menu section. In the  **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section, click **[!UICONTROL Manage]**. The list of actions is displayed. See [this page](../start/user-interface.md) for more information on the interface.

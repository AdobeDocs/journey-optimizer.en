Actions are connections through which you deliver personalized, real-time experiences to customers such as push notifications, email, SMS, or any other means of digital engagement you use in your business.

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] comes with built-in message capability. Refer to [this section](../messages/get-started-content.md).

If you have Adobe Campaign v7 or v8, an integration is available upon request. Refer to [this page](../action/acc-action.md).

If you're using a third-party system to send messages such as Epsilon, Facebook, Adobe.io, Firebase, etc, you need to add and configure a custom action. Refer to [this page](../action/about-custom-action-configuration.md).

Custom actions enable you to configure connection of a third-party system to send messages or API calls. An action can be configured with any service from any provider that can be called through a REST API with a JSON-formatted payload.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The configuration of custom actions must be performed by a **technical user**.

The actions are available in the left palette of your journey, in the **[!UICONTROL Action]** category. See [this page](../building-journeys/about-journey-activities.md#action-activities).

To view the action list or configure a new action, select **[!UICONTROL Configurations]** in the ADMINISTRATION menu section. In the  **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section, click **[!UICONTROL Manage]**. The list of actions is displayed. See [this page](../start/user-interface.md) for more information on the interface.

# Reporting in Customer Journey Analytics {#cja}

If you are working with Customer Journey Analytics, you can create custom reporting dashboards for your code-based campaigns leveraging Experience Decisioning.

The main steps are listed below. Detailed information on how to work with Customer Journey Analytics is available in the [Customer Journey Analytics documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-landing){target="_blank"}.

1. Create and configure a **connection** in Customer Journey Analytics. This allows you to connect to the dataset you want reports for. [Learn how to create a connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-connections/create-connection){target="_blank"}

1. Create a **data view** and associate it to the connection created earlier. In the **[!UICONTROL Components]** tab, choose the relevant schema fields you want to show up in reporting. For Experience Decisioning, make sure you include the **propositioninteract** and **propositiondisplay** fields.

# Deliver offers using the Code-Based Experience channel {#deliver}

Experience Decisioning is available today via Code-Based Experience channel. 

Code-based experience supports any type of customer implementation:

* If you have a **client-side** implementation, you can use one of the AEP client SDKs: AEP Web SDK or AEP Mobile SDK.
* If you have a **server-side** implementation, you can use one the AEP Edge Network API.
* If you have a **hybrid** implementation, you can use both Web SDK and Edge Network Server API.

Detailed information on the different implementation methods is available in the code-based channel guide. In this guide, you will find details on each implementation methods, as well as sample implementations for different personalization and experimentation use cases.

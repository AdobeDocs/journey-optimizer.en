# Get started with [!DNL Journey Optimizer] decision capabilities {#gs-decision}

The decision capabilities in [!DNL Journey Optimizer] empower you to deliver the best offers and personalized experiences to your customers across all touchpoints, at precisely the right moments. These capabilities simplify personalization through a centralized catalog of marketing offers and an advanced decision engine, which uses rules and ranking criteria to deliver the most relevant content for each individual.

Key benefits:

* Improved campaign performance by delivering personalized offers across multiple channels,
* Improved workflows: instead of creating multiple deliveries or campaigns, marketing teams can improve workflows by creating a single delivery and vary the offers in different parts of the template,
* Control over the number of times an offer is shown across campaigns and customers.

Currently, [!DNL Journey Optimizer] provides the two core solutions detailed below.

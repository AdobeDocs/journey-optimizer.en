>The In-app feature is currently available as a beta to select users only. To join the beta program, contact Adobe Customer Care. 

In-app messages are notifications you can send to users inside your app to direct them toward specific points of interest. In-app notifications can be used to propose a service, promote a new feature, a special offer, or onboard a new user. 

Use Journey Optimizer to create In-app notifications, and configure experience options, including the message layout and display, text, and button options.

## Prerequisites{#prerequisites-in-app}

Before sending In-app messages, you need to:

* Configure the In-app channel. [Learn more](inapp-configuration.md)

* Make sure you have the correct permissions on Journey Optimizer campaigns before starting. [Learn more](../campaigns/get-started-with-campaigns.md#campaign-prerequisites)

Once done, you can create, configure and sent your first In-app message. Learn how to achieve this in [this section](create-in-app.md).

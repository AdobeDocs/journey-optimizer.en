# Check and send your In-app notification {#create-in-app}

## Preview on device {#preview-device}

If you want to get a sneak peek of the In-app notification before it goes live for all users, you have the ability to preview it on a specific device. This functionality allows you to ensure that the notification looks and functions as intended on the chosen device, providing a better user experience for your audience.

To perform this, follow the steps below: 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Preview on device]**.

1. Scan the QR code with your device and enter the PIN code displayed. 
 
Your In-app message can now be triggered directly on your device allowing you to preview and review your message on an actual device. 

## Preview with test profiles {#simulate}

Once your in-app message has been defined, you can use test profiles to preview it. If you inserted personalized content, you can check how this content is displayed in the message, using test profile data.

To do this, click **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** then add a test profile to check your message using the test profile data.

Detailed information on how to select test profiles and preview your content is available in the [Content Management](../content-management/preview-test.md) section.

## Review and activate your In-App notification{#in-app-review}

>Starting September release, a new campaign and journey activation experience allows you to manage the entire approval process, ensuring that campaigns and journeys are thoroughly reviewed and approved by the appropriate stakeholders before going live. This feature is available in Limited Availability. [Learn more](../test-approve/gs-approval.md)

Once your In-App message is created, and its content defined and personalized, you can review and activate it.

To perform this, follow the steps below:

1. Use the **[!UICONTROL Review to activate]** button to display a summary of your message.

    The summary allows you to modify your campaign if necessary, and to check if any parameter is incorrect or missing.

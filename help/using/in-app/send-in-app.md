## Preview on device {#preview-device}

If you want to get a sneak peek of the In-app notification before it goes live for all users, you have the ability to preview it on a specific device. This functionality allows you to ensure that the notification looks and functions as intended on the chosen device, providing a better user experience for your audience.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Preview on device]**.

1. Scan the QR code with your device and enter the PIN code displayed. 

Your In-app message can now be triggered directly on your device allowing you to preview and review your message on an actual device. 

## Review and activate your In-App notification{#in-app-review}

Once your In-App message is created, and its content defined and personalized, you can review and activate it.

To perform this, follow the steps below:

1. Use the **[!UICONTROL Review to activate]** button to display a summary of your message.

    The summary allows you to modify your campaign if necessary, and to check if any parameter is incorrect or missing.

1. Check that your campaign is correctly configured, then click **[!UICONTROL Activate]**.

Your campaign is now activated. The In-App notification configured in the campaign is sent immediately, or on the specified date.

Once sent, you can measure the impact of your In-App messages within the Campaign report. For more on reporting, refer to [this section](../reports/campaign-global-report.md#inapp-report).

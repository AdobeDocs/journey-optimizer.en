# Create an In-app message {#create-in-app}

You can add an In-app message in a campaign or in a journey. Follow the steps detailed below to create an In-app message in both contexts.

>[!BEGINTABS]

>[!TAB Add an In-app message to a journey]

To add an In-app message in a journey, follow these steps:

1. Open your journey, then drag and drop an **[!UICONTROL In-app]** activity from the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section of the palette.

    When a profile reaches the end of their journey, any in-app messages displayed to them will automatically expire. For that reason, a Wait activity is automatically added after your In-app activity to ensure proper timing.

1. Enter a **[!UICONTROL Label]** and **[!UICONTROL Description]** for your message.

1. Choose the [In-app surface](inapp-configuration.md) to use.

    ![](assets/in_app_journey_2.png)

1. You can now start designing your content with the **[!UICONTROL Edit content]** button. [Learn more](design-in-app.md)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Edit triggers]** to choose the event(s) and criteria that will trigger your message. Rule builders enable users to specify criteria and values that, when met, trigger a set of actions, such as sending an in-app message.

    ![](assets/in_app_journey_4.png)

    1. Click the event drop-down to change your Trigger if needed.

        | Package | Trigger | Definition |
        |---|---|---|
        |Send data to Platform|Sent data to Platform|Triggered when the mobile app issues an edge experience event to send data to Adobe Experience Platform. Usually the API call [sendEvent](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/documentation/edge-network/api-reference/#sendevent) from the AEP Edge extension.|
        |Core tracking|Track action| Triggered when the legacy functionality offered in mobile code API [trackAction](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/documentation/mobile-core/api-reference/#trackaction) is called.|

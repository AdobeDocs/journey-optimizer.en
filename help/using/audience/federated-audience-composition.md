# Federated Audience Composition {#fac}

While you can use the audience composition capabilities to create valuable, highly refined audiences for targeting, you can further enrich audiences for deeper personalization using data from your enterprise data warehouse and trusted partners.

The Federated Audience Composition capability available in Adobe [!DNL Journey Optimizer] can query a data warehouse for data or profile
attributes to use in composing audiences, leaving sensitive data in the warehouse and avoiding data duplication. This can include both profile-based data and non-profile data. For example, a quick-service restaurant group could enrich profiles of customers
that recently placed orders online with each customer's preferred restaurant location, enabling the restaurant group to send customers offers that can be used at those preferred locations.

* **Data integration** - Boost flexibility and efficiency with ability to query relevant pre-built audiences and datasets from your enterprise data warehouse and partners into a single environment to augment Adobe Experience Platform use cases.
* **Enhanced marketing processes** - Unlock additional support for segmentation, targeting, and activation use cases with streamlined, adaptable workflows.
* **Efficient data management** - Minimize data copy, govern sensitive
data usage, and optimize IT investments to complement real-time cross-channel use cases on Adobe

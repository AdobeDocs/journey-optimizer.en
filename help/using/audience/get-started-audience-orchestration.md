Audience composition allows you to create **composition workflows**, where you can combine existing Adobe Experience Platform audiences into a visual canvas and leverage various activities (split, exclude...) to create new audiences.

Once done, the **resulting audiences** are saved backed into Adobe Experience Platform along with existing audiences and can be leveraged in Journey Optimizer campaigns and journeys to target customers.

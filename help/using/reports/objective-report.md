# Campaign global report {#objective-report}

Campaign global report can be accessed directly from your Campaign with the **[!UICONTROL View report]** button.

The Campaign **[!UICONTROL Global report]** is divided into different widgets detailing your campaign's success and errors. Each widget can be resized and deleted if needed. For more information on this, refer to this [section](../reports/global-report.md#modify-dashboard).

For a detailed list of every metric available in Adobe Journey Optimizer, refer to [this page](global-report.md#list-of-components-global.md)

The **[!UICONTROL Objectives]** tab allows you to better fine-tune your deliveries' reports by targeting one specific metric.

The **[!UICONTROL Objectives]** listed are linked to **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** that define a connection to a system in order to retrieve additional information. A list of built-in **[!UICONTROL Objectives]** is available but you can add your own by adding new **[!UICONTROL Dataset]**. For the detailed procedure, refer to this [section](../campaigns/reporting-configuration.md).

After selecting the Objectives you want to target on, the two **[!UICONTROL Performance overview]** and **[!UICONTROL Campaign objective]** widgets will provide a detailed summary of your delivery performance. 

With the **[!UICONTROL Campaign objective]** widget, you can also choose to compare your main objective with another metric.

### Experimentation report {#experimentation-global-objectives}

Note that defining the best performer might take some time, it will be represented by this icon ![](assets/experimentation_report_1.png).

The **[!UICONTROL Experiment result]** widget details the performance of each variant. You can change your baseline by selecting one of the treatment from the **[!UICONTROL Baseline]** the drop-down. The best treatment will be represented with a star icon.

The table presents the following metrics:

* **[!UICONTROL Lift over baseline]**: Measure of the percentage improvement in conversion rate of a given treatment over the baseline.

*  **[!UICONTROL Confidence]**: Evidence that a given treatment is the same as the baseline treatment. [Learn more](../campaigns/experiment-calculations.md#understand-confidence)

*  **[!UICONTROL Unique outbound clicks]**: Total count of clicks across outbound channels.

* **[!UICONTROL Profiles]**: Number of profiles targeted for this treatment.

*  **[!UICONTROL Unique outbound clicks/profiles]**: Total value of the Success metric, previously selected when creating your Experiments, divided by the number of profiles.

The **[!UICONTROL Confidence interval]** graph measures uncertainty around improvement. It details the percentage difference in performance between the baseline and the best performing treatment. [Learn more](../campaigns/experiment-calculations.md#confidence-intervals).

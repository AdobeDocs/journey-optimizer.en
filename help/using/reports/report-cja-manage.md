## Define the report period {#report-period}

![](assets/cja-time-period.png)

When accessing a report, you can apply a time period filter, located at the top right corner of the report.

By default, the filter period for a campaign or journey is set to its start and end dates. If there is no end date, the filter will default to the current date.

To modify the filter, you can select a custom start date and duration, or choose from preset options such as last week or two months ago.

The report will automatically update once the filter is applied or modified.

## Export your reports {#export-reports}

# Get started with Channel reports {#channel-report-gs}

The Channel reports serve as a powerful tool that provides a comprehensive overview of traffic and engagement metrics into a unified report for each channel, encompassing all Actions from all Campaigns and Journeys. It is divided into different widgets, each of which provides a specific view of your campaign or journey performance.

The Channel reports are fully customizable, so you can resize or remove widgets to create a dashboard that meets your specific needs. You can also export the report data to a PDF or CSV file for further analysis.

Learn more on the different metrics and widgets available for the Channel reports in this [page](channel-report.md).

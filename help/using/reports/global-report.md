Use the **[!UICONTROL Global report]** to measure the impact of your journeys and deliveries over a selected time period.

* If you want to target a journey or deliveries in the context of a journey, from the **[!UICONTROL Journeys]** menu, access your journey and click the **[!UICONTROL View report]** button. You can then find the Journey, Email, SMS and Push global reports.

## Customize dashboard {#modify-dashboard}

Each reporting dashboard can be modified by changing the time period and resizing or removing widgets. Changing the widgets only impacts the current user's dashboard. Other users will see their own dashboards or the ones set by default.

1. From your Global report, select a Start and End time to target specific data.

    Note that the **[!UICONTROL Exclude test events]** option is only available for Journey reports.

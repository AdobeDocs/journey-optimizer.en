* **[!UICONTROL Engagement Rate]**: Percentage of opens and actions for this push notification, i.e. if the profile opened the push or if a button was clicked on.

The **[!UICONTROL Push notification summary]** graph contains the data available for sent push notifications, such as:

* **[!UICONTROL Opens]**: Number of times a message was opened in a delivery.

* **[!UICONTROL Actions]**: Total number of actions on the push notification delivered, e.g. button click or dismissal.

Global reports, accessible from the All time tab, display events that occurred at least two hours ago and cover events over a selected time period. In comparison, Live reports focus on events that took place within the past 24 hours, with a minimum time interval of two minutes from the event occurrence. 

To access your reports, click the **[!UICONTROL Report]** icon of your selected subscription list.

The **[!UICONTROL Subscription performance]** KPIs and the **[!UICONTROL Subscriptions by journey]**/**[!UICONTROL Unsubscribes by journey]** tables detail the main information relative to your visitors' engagement with your landing page. The tables and KPIs contain the data available related to your landing page, such as:

* **[!UICONTROL Subscribes]**: Total number of subscriptions for the concerned period.

* **[!UICONTROL Unsubscribes]**: Total number of unsubscriptions for the concerned period.

The **[!UICONTROL Subscription performance]** graph shows the evolution of subscriptions for the concerned period.

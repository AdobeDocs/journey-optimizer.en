Global reports, accessible from the All time tab, display events that occurred at least two hours ago and cover events over a selected time period. In comparison, Live reports focus on events that took place within the past 24 hours, with a minimum time interval of two minutes from the event occurrence. 

To access your reports, select **[!UICONTROL Report]** from the advanced menu of your selected landing page.

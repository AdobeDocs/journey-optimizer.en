Live reports, accessible from the Last 24 hrs tab, display events that took place within the past 24 hours, with a minimum time interval of two minutes from the event occurrence. In comparison, Global reports focus on events that occurred at least two hours ago and cover events over a selected time period. 

To access your reports, click the **[!UICONTROL Report]** icon of your selected subscription list.

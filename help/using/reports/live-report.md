# Get started with Live Report {#live-report}

Use the **[!UICONTROL Live report]** to measure and visualize in real-time the impact and performances of your journeys and your messages in a built-in dashboard.
Data are available in the **[!UICONTROL Live report]** as soon as your delivery is sent or your journey is executed from the **[!UICONTROL Last 24hrs]** tab. 

* If you want to target a journey in the context of a journey, from the **[!UICONTROL Journeys]** menu, access your journey and click the **[!UICONTROL View report]** button.

## Customize dashboard {#modify-dashboard}

Each reporting dashboard can be modified by resizing or removing widgets. Changing the widgets only impacts the current user's dashboard. Other users will see their own dashboards or the ones set by default. 

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** drop-down, choose if you want to report on one particular action of your journeys.

1. Choose if you want to exclude test events from your reports with the toggle bar. For more information on test events, refer to [this page](../building-journeys/testing-the-journey.md).

    Note that the **[!UICONTROL Exclude test events]** option is only available for Journey reports.

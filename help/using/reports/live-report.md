# Get started with Live Report {#live-report}

Use the **[!UICONTROL Live report]** to measure and visualize in real-time the impact and performances of your journeys and your messages in a built-in dashboard.
Data are available in the **[!UICONTROL Live report]** as soon as your delivery is sent or your journey is executed. 

* If you want to target a journey or deliveries in the context of a journey, from the **[!UICONTROL Journeys]** menu, access your journey and click the **[!UICONTROL Live report]** icon. You can then find the Journey, Email and Push live reports.

## Customize dashboard {#modify-dashboard}

Each reporting dashboard can be modified by resizing or removing widgets. Changing the widgets only impacts the current user's dashboard. Other users will see their own dashboards or the ones set by default. 

1. From your live report, click **[!UICONTROL Modify]**.

1. Once you are satisfied with the display order and the size of your widgets, click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

Your dashboard is now saved. Your different changes will be reapplied for a later use of your live reports. If needed, use the **[!UICONTROL Reset]** option to restore the default widgets and widgets' order.

# In-app journey report {#journey-global-report}

>[!BEGINSHADEBOX]

Your journey report may show information from multiple journeys simultaneously, as users can be involved in more than one journey at a time. As a result, inbound communications (In-App, Web and Code-based) may show up in multiple journeys if they were triggered for a user participating in simultaneous active journeys, which can result in overlapping data.

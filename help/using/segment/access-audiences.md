# Access and manage audiences {#access-manage-audiences}

<table style="table-layout:fixed"><tr style="border: 0;"><tr><td valign="middle">Learn how to access and manage audiences created with the audience composition feature.</td><td><ul>
<li><a href="get-started-audience-orchestration.md">Get started with audience composition</a></li>

Audiences resulting from audience composition are accessible from the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab in the **[!UICONTROL Segments]** menu.

This tab lists all audiences stored into Adobe Experience Platform. Audiences created using audience compositions are identifiable by the **[!UICONTROL Audience composition]** origin.

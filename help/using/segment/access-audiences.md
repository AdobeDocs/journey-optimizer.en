# Access and manage audiences {#access-manage-audiences}

* [Get started with audience composition](get-started-audience-orchestration.md)
* [Create your first composition workflow](create-compositions.md)
* [Work with the composition canvas](composition-canvas.md)
* **[Access and manage audiences](access-audiences.md)**

Audiences resulting from audience composition are accessible from the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab in the **[!UICONTROL Segments]** menu.

This tab lists all audiences stored into Adobe Experience Platform. Audiences created using audience compositions are identifiable by the **[!UICONTROL Audience composition]** origin.

# Access and manage audiences {#access-manage-audiences}

Audiences are accessible from the **[!UICONTROL Audiences]** tab in the **[!UICONTROL Segments]** menu.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>For now, audiences resulting from composition workflows cannot be targeted into Journey Optimizer.

This tab lists all audiences stored into Adobe Experience Platform. Audiences created using audience compositions are identifiable by the **[!UICONTROL Audience composition]** origin.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For more information on other types of audiences available in Adobe Experience Platform, refer to the [Segmentation Service documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/ui/overview.html). 

The **[!UICONTROL Profile count]** column provides information on the number of profiles included in an audience. Click the "i" button for more information on the date this information has been calculated.

To assign custom or core data usage labels to an audience, click the ellipse button then select **[!UICONTROL Manage Access]**. [Learn more on Object Level Access Control (OLA)](../administration/object-based-access.md)

## About audience composition {#about}
 
Audience composition allows you to create **composition workflows**, where you can combine existing Adobe Experience Platform audiences into a visual canvas and leverage various activites (split, exclude...) to create new audiences.

Once done, the **resulting audiences** are saved backed into Adobe Experience Platform along with existing audiences and can be **leveraged in campaigns** to target customers.

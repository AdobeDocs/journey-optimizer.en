# Create a content experiment {#content-experiment}

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>The **Content Experiment** feature is currently only available for a set of organizations (Limited Availability). For more information, contact your Adobe representative.

Use Journey Optimizer Content Experiment to define multiple delivery treatments. The audience of interest is randomly allocated to each treatment in order to determine which one performs best with respect to the metric of interest. You can choose to vary the emailâ€™s content, subject, or sender. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Before starting with Content Experiment, make sure that your reporting configuration is set for your custom datasets. Learn more in [this section](reporting-configuration.md).

In the example below, the delivery target has been split into two groups, each representing 45% of the targeted population, and a holdout group of 10%, who will not receive the delivery.

Each person in the targeted audience will receive one version of the email, with a subject line that is one of the following two:

* one directly promoting a 10% offer on the new collection and an image.
* the other one only advertising a special offer without specifying the 10% off without any image. 

The goal here is to see if recipients will interact with the email depending on the received experiment. We therefore will choose **[!UICONTROL Email Opens]** as the primary goal metric in this Content Experiment.

## Objectives report {#objectives-global}

![](assets/performance_report.gif)

The **[!UICONTROL Objectives]** tab of your Campaign report allows you to better fine-tune your deliveries' reports by targeting one specific metric.

The **[!UICONTROL Objectives]** listed are linked to **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** that define a connection to a system in order to retrieve additional information. A list of built-in **[!UICONTROL Objectives]** is available but you can add your own by adding new **[!UICONTROL Dataset]**. For the detailed procedure, refer to this [section](reporting-configuration.md).

After selecting the Objectives you want to target on, the two **[!UICONTROL Performance overview]** and **[!UICONTROL Campaign objective]** widgets will provide a detailed summary of your delivery performance. 

With the **[!UICONTROL Campaign objective]** widget, you can also choose to compare your main objective with another metric.

Note that each widget can be resized and deleted if needed. For more information on this, refer to this [section](../reports/global-report.md#modify-dashboard).

## Experimentation report {#experimentation-global}

>The Content experiment feature is currently only available for a set of organizations (Limited Availability). For more information, contact your Adobe representative.

![](assets/experimentation_report_3.png)

From your Campaign **[!UICONTROL Global report]**, the **[!UICONTROL Experimentation]** tab details the main information relative to how each variant is performing and if there is a best performer.

Note that defining the best performer might take some time, it will be represented by this icon ![](assets/experimentation_report_1.png).

The **[!UICONTROL Experiment result]** widget details the performance of each variant. You can change your baseline by selecting one of the treatment from the **[!UICONTROL Baseline]** the drop-down. The best treatment will be represented with a star icon.

The table presents the following metrics:

* **[!UICONTROL Profiles]**: Number of profiles targeted for this treatment.

*  **[!UICONTROL Unique outbound clicks]**: Total count of clicks across outbound channels.

*  **[!UICONTROL Count per profile]**: Total value of the Experiment objective metric divided by the number of profiles.

*  **[!UICONTROL Confidence interval]**: Percentage difference in performance between the baseline and the best performing treatment. [Learn more](../campaigns/experiment-calculations.md#confidence-intervals).

*  **[!UICONTROL Average lift]**: Percentage improvement in conversion rate of a given treatment over the baseline. [Learn more](../campaigns/experiment-calculations.md#understand-lift)

*  **[!UICONTROL Confidence]**: Evidence that a given treatment is the same as the baseline treatment. [Learn more](../campaigns/experiment-calculations.md#understand-confidence)

For a deep-dive in these results and how to interpret them, refer to [this page](../campaigns/get-started-experiment.md#interpret-results).

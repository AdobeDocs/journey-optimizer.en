# Create a content experiment {#content-experiment}

The content experiment feature allows you to define multiple delivery treatments. The audience of interest is randomly allocated to each treatment in order to determine which one performs best with respect to the metric of interest. You can choose to vary the emailâ€™s content, subject, or sender. 

In the example below, the delivery target has been split into two groups, each representing 45% of the targeted population, and a holdout group of 10%, who will not receive the delivery.

Each person in the targeted audience will receive one version of the email, with a subject line that is one of the following two:

* one directly promoting a 10% offer on the new collection and an image.
* the other one only advertising a special offer without specifying the 10% off without any image. 

The goal here is to see if recipients will interact with the email depending on the received experiment. We therefore will choose **[!UICONTROL Email Opens]** as the primary goal metric in this Content Experiment.

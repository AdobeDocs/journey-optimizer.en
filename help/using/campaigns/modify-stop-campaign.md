# Manage live campaigns {#modify-stop-campaign}

Once a campaign has been activated, you can modify or stop it at any time. These operations are available for campaigns with a recurring execution only. 

Additionally, you can duplicate live campaigns (executed once or with a recurring execution) to create new ones.

## Modify a recurring campaign {#modify}

To modify and create a new version of a recurring campaign, follow these steps:

1. Open the campaign then click the **[!UICONTROL Modify campaign]** button.

1. A new version of the campaign is created. You can check the live version by clicking **[!UICONTROL Open live version]**.

    In the campaigns list, activated campaigns with a draft version in progress display with a specific icon in the **[!UICONTROL Status]** column. Click this icon to open the draft version of the campaign.

1. Once your changes are ready, you can activate the new version of the campaign (see [Review and activate a campaign](create-campaign.md#review-activate)).

    >[!IMPORTANT]

    >Activating the draft will replace the live version of the campaign.

## Stop a recurring campaign {#stop}

To stop a recurring campaign, open it then click the **[!UICONTROL Stop campaign]** button.

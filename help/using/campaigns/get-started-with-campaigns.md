Use Journey Optimizer campaigns to deliver one-time content to a specific audience using various channels. When using journeys, actions are executed in sequence. With campaigns, actions are performed simultaneously, either immediately, or based on a specified schedule.

You can create two types of campaigns:

* **Scheduled campaigns** allow for simple ad-hoc batch communications for marketing use cases like promotional offers, engagement campaigns, announcements, legal notices, or policy updates.
* **API-triggered campaigns** allow either for marketing communications to reach out to an audience at the right time, or for transactional/operational messages to an individual like a password reset, where the need may involve personalization by not just using profile attribute but also the real-time context data in the trigger which is a REST API payload.

The main steps to create a campaign are as follows:

## Before starting {#campaign-prerequisites}

Check the following prerequisites before starting creating your first campaign in Journey Optimizer:

1. **You need proper permissions**. Campaigns are only available to users with access to a campaign related **[!UICONTROL Product profile]** such as Campaign administrator, Campaign approver, Campaign manager and/or Campaign viewer.If you cannot access campaigns, your permissions must be extended.

    +++Learn how to assign campaign related role

    1. To assign a role to a user in the [!DNL Permissions] product, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** tab and select one of the built-in campaign related **[!UICONTROL Roles]**: Campaign administrator, Campaign approver, Campaign manager or Campaign viewer. 

    1. From the **[!UICONTROL Users]** tab, click **[!UICONTROL Add user]**.

    1. Type in your user's name or email address or select the user fom the list and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

        If the user was not previously created, refer to the [Add users documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/access-control/ui/users).

    Your user should then receive an email redirecting to your instance.

    +++

1. **You need an audience**. Audiences need to be available before creating the campaign. Learn more about audiences [in this page](../audience/about-audiences.md).
1. **You need a channel surface**. To be able to select a channel, you must have the corresponding channel surface (i.e preset) created and available. Learn more about channel surfaces [in this page](../configuration/channel-surfaces.md).

## About campaigns {#about}

Campaigns allow you to deliver one-time content to a specific segment using multiple channels.

Unlike journeys, where actions are designed to be executed in sequence, campaigns execute actions simultaneously, either immediately, or on a specified schedule.

You can use them, for example, to deliver promotional offers, engagement campaigns, announcements, legal notices, or policy updates.

Additionally, campaigns' content experiment feature allows you to test multiple variables of a delivery on populations samples, in order to define which treatment has the biggest impact on the targeted population.

Learn how to manage campaigns and content experiments:
* [Create a campaign](create-campaign.md)
* [Modify or stop a campaign](modify-stop-campaign.md)
* [Create a content experiment](content-experiment.md)

## Access campaigns {#access}

Campaigns are accessible from the **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]** menu.

By default, the list shows all campaigns with the **[!UICONTROL Draft]**, **[!UICONTROL Scheduled]**, and **[!UICONTROL Live]** statuses. To display stopped, completed and archived campaigns, you need to clear the filter.

## Campaign statuses {#statuses}

Campaigns can have multiple statuses:

* **[!UICONTROL Draft]**: The campaign is being edited, it has not been activated.
* **[!UICONTROL Activating]**: The campaign is being activated.
* **[!UICONTROL Live]**: The campaign has been activated.
* **[!UICONTROL Scheduled]**: The campaign has been activated with a start date.
* **[!UICONTROL Stopped]**: The campaign has been stopped. You cannot activate or reuse it anymore (see [Stop a campaign](modify-stop-campaign.md#stop))
* **[!UICONTROL Completed]**: The campaign is complete.
* **[!UICONTROL Archived]**: The campaign has been archived.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The "Open draft version" icon next to a **[!UICONTROL Live]** or **[!UICONTROL Scheduled]** status indicates that a new version of the campaign has been created and has not been activated yet (see [Modify a campaign](modify-stop-campaign.md#modify)).

# Get started with campaigns {#get-started-campaigns}

Campaigns allow you to deliver one-time content to a specific segment using multiple channels.

Unlike journeys, where actions are designed to be executed in sequence, campaign execute actions simultaneously, either immediately, or on a specified schedule.

You can use them, for example, to deliver promotional offers, engagement campaigns, announcements, legal notices, or policy updates.

Additionally, campaigns' content experiment feature allows you to test multiple variables of a delivery on populations samples, in order to define which treatment has the biggest impact on the targeted population.

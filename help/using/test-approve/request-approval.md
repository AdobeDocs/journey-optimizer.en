# Request approval {#request-approval}

>[!AVAILABILITY]

> Approval policies are currently only available for a set of organizations (Limited Availability). To gain access, contact your Adobe representative.

If the approval workflow capability has been enabled for your organization, you will notice that the **[!UICONTROL Activate]** and **[!UICONTROL Publish]** buttons are no longer available in the create Campaign and create Journey workflows, respectively. These buttons have been replaced by the **[!UICONTROL Request Approval]** button.

After creating your campaign or journey, you need to click the **[!UICONTROL Request Approval]** button. This will check if there is an active approval policy in your sandbox that applies to the campaign or journey. If a relevant approval policy is found, the approval process will begin. If no applicable approval policy exists, the campaign or journey will be automatically approved and either activated or published.

The **[!UICONTROL Request approval]** pane opens. Provide a message for the approver(s) if necessary and click **[!UICONTROL Send]** to submit your request.

While the campaign or journey is **[!UICONTROL In review]** state, you have the option to cancel the approval request. By clicking the **[!UICONTROL Cancel request]** button, the campaign or journey will return to the draft stage, and a notification will be sent to the reviewers informing them that the request has been canceled. You can then make the necessary edits and resubmit the campaign or journey for approval.

Once that the approval request has been sent to the approvers, they can review it and either activate the journey/campaign to make it live, or request changes if necessary. [Learn how to review & approve a request](review-approve-request.md)

If the approvers request changes, you are notified through an email and a Journey Optimizer alert, which is accessible when clicking the bell icon on top right of the screen, in the **[!UICONTROL Requests]** tab.

To go through the change request, open it from the email or the alert to access the journey or campaign and make the requested changes. When your journey/campaign is ready to be reviewed again, send a new approval request using the **[!UICONTROL Request approval]** button.

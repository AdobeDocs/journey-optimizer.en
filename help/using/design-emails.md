* **Code or paste raw HTML** directly in the email designer. Learn how to code your own content [in this section](existing-content.md#import-raw-html-code).

* **Import existing HTML content** from a file or a .zip folder. Learn how to import an email content [in this section](existing-content.md#import-html-content-from-file).

# Get started with push notification {#gs-push-notification}

>If this is your first time creating an Push Notification, make sure the Push channel has been configured. [Learn more](push-gs.md).

Push notifications help you reach your mobile app users at any time - especially when they are not actively using your app. Push notifications may help you achieve a variety of use cases such as providing updates about your service, ask a user to take action, alert the user to a new deal, etc. Device platforms require opt-in before end-users may receive or view your notifications. User opt-in may be received as early as after the app is launched for the first time post-install, or in a subsequent session or workflow as appropriate. 

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] supports push notifications and helps you send highly relevant notifications at industry-leading throughput rates. Push notifications may include personalization and Journey-based context in order to leverage data insights your brand has with Adobe Experience Cloud.

Push notifications can be created:

* In a **Journey**: Once you added a Push activity in your journey, and defined basic settings, use the **[!UICONTROL Actions: Push]** right pane to create the content for the Push notifications. 

    For more information on how to configure your journey, refer to this [page](../building-journeys/journey-gs.md).

* In a **Campaign**: Once you created a campaign, select Push notification as your action and define basic settings. 

    For more information on how to configure your campaign, refer to this [page](../campaigns/create-campaign.md#configure).

Use the dedicated tabs to define the push notification settings for **iOS** and **Android** operating systems.

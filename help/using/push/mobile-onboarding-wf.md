# Mobile onboarding quick start workflow {#mobile-wf}

The new **mobile onboarding quick start workflow** is a new product feature to rapidly configure the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK, start collecting and validating mobile event data, and send push notifications with [!DNL Journey Optimizer]. 

This capability is accessible via the **[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection]** home page to all customers as a public Beta.

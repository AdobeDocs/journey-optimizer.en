# Get started for Marketers

As a **Marketer** or a **Journey Practicionner**, you are responsible for creating messages, offers and journeys. You can start working with [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] once the [System Administrator](administrator.md) and the [Data Engineer](data-engineer.md) granted you access and prepared your environment.

Refer to the following sections to set up your first journey, add offers and assets, and send messages:

1. **Create segments**. Journey Optimizer allows you to create audience segments directly from the **Segments** menu, and leverage them into your journeys.  Learn more about segments [in this page](../segment/about-segments.md). Discover how to build segments [in this sample](../segment/creating-a-segment.md).

1. **Create messages**. Learn how to create email and push notifications in Journey Optimizer [in this page](../create-message.md).

1. **Test and validate your messages**. Once your message content has been defined, you can use test profiles to preview and test it. If you inserted [personalized content](../personalization/personalize.md), you will be able to check how this content is displayed in the message, leveraging test profile data. In addition, leverage your **Litmus** account into [!DNL Journey Optimizer] to instantly preview your **email rendering** in popular email clients. You can then ensure your email content looks great and works properly in every inbox. Learn how to test and validate your messages [in this section](../preview.md).

1. **Design customer journeys** to deliver personalized, contextual experiences. [!DNL Journey Optimizer] allow you to build real-time orchestration use cases leveraging contextual data stored in events or data sources. Design multistep advanced scenarios powered by following capabilities:

    * Send real-time **unitary messages** triggered when an event is received, or **in batch** using Adobe Experience Platform segments.

    * Leverage **contextual data** from events, information from Adobe Experience Platform, or data from third-party API services.

    * Use the **built-in action** to send messages designed in [!DNL Journey Optimizer] or create **custom actions** if you're using a third-party system to send your messages.

    * With the **journey designer**, build your multistep use cases: easily drag and drop an entry event or a read segment activity, add conditions and send personalized messages.

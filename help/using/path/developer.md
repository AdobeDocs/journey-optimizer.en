## Integrate your mobile app

As a Developer, you need to **configure your mobile app** to be able to send push notifications with [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer].

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to create your journeys and send messages to targeted audience. Before beginning to send push notifications with [!DNL Journey Optimizer], you need to ensure configurations and integrations are in place on the mobile app, and in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] and [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch]. To understand the Push Notifications data flow in [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] please refer to [this page](../push-gs.md). 

Steps to configure the push notification channel and test your mobile app integration are detailed in [this page](../push-configuration.md).

You can also perform multiple actions with **[!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] APIs**.

Steps to help you start using the [!DNL Offer Library] API are detailed [in this section](../offers/api-reference/getting-started.md). This guide provides sample API calls for performing key operations using the Decision Management Engine.

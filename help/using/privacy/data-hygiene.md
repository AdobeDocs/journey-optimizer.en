# Perform data lifecycle operations {#data-hygiene}

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>Data lifecycle capabilities are currently only available for organizations that have purchased the **Healthcare Shield** and **Privacy and Security Shield** add-on offerings.

As data is continuously ingested into Adobe Experience Platform, it becomes crucial to ensure your data is used as intended, updated when necessary, and deleted per organizational policies.

These tasks can be accomplished using the **[!UICONTROL Data Lifecycle]** menu, which allows you to configure and schedule data lifecycle operations, ensuring that your records are properly maintained.

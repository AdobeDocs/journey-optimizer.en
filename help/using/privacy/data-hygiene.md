As data is continuously ingested into Adobe Experience Platform, it becomes crucial to ensure your data is used as intended, updated when necessary, and deleted per organizational policies.

These tasks can be accomplished using the **[!UICONTROL Data Hygiene]** menu, which allows you to configure and schedule data hygiene operations, ensuring that your records are properly maintained.

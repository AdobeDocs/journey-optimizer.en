# Integrate with other solutions {#integration}

With Adobe Journey Optimizer, you can easily manage, retain, and export this data to platforms or systems that are part of your technology stack. 

## Work with Adobe Customer Journey Analytics{#integration-cja}

You can export data generated by Journey Optimizer to perform advanced analysis in Customer Journey Analytics.

Journey Optimizer integration with Customer Journey Analytics provides an holistic view of all your journeys with automated report distribution and custom visualizations of the data.

After creating your journey in Journey Optimizer, you can import your customer data to Customer Journey Analytics to start reports and understand the impact of every interaction a customer has with your journeys.

Learn more about [Journey Optimizer + Customer Journey Analytics](../reports/cja-ajo.md).

## Work with Adobe Analytics{#integration-aa}

You can leverage all of the Adobe Analytics behavioral event data that you are already capturing and streaming into Adobe Experience Platform in order to trigger journeys and automate experiences for your customers.

## Work with Adobe Real-Time Customer Profile{#integration-profile}

Adobe Experience Platform data source defines the connection to the Real-time Customer Profile Service. This data source is built-in and pre-configured. It cannot be deleted. This data source is designed to retrieve and use data from the Real-time Customer Profile Service (for example, check if the person who entered a journey is a female). It allows you to use Profile data and Experience Events data. For more information on the Real-time Customer Profile Service, refer to Adobe Experience Platform documentation.


## Work with Adobe Intelligent Services{#integration-ai}

The integration with Adobe Intelligent Services allows you to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning in customer experience use cases. This allows for marketing analysts to set up predictions specific to a companyâ€™s needs using business-level configurations without the need for data science expertise.

## Work with Adobe Campaign{#integration-ac}

An integration is available if you have Adobe Campaign v7 or v8. It will allow you to send emails, push notifications and SMS using Adobe Campaign Transactional Messaging capabilities.

## Work with external systems{#integration-external-systems}

Journey Optimizer allows you to configure connections to external systems via custom data sources and custom actions. This allows you, for example, to enrich your journeys with data coming from an external reservation system, or send messages using a third-party system such as Epsilon or Facebook.

Learn how to use external data sources to define a connection to a third-party system in [this section](../datasource/external-data-sources.md).

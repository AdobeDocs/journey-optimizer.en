## Integrate your mobile app {#integrate-mobile-app}

As a Developer, you need to **configure your mobile app** to be able to send push notifications with [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer].

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to create your journeys and send messages to targeted audience. Before beginning to send push notifications with [!DNL Journey Optimizer], you need to ensure configurations and integrations are in place on the mobile app, and in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] and [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch]. To understand the Push Notifications data flow in [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] please refer to [this page](../../push/push-gs.md). 

Steps to configure the push notification channel and test your mobile app integration are detailed in [this page](../../push/push-configuration.md).

# Accessibility in Journey Optimizer{#accessibility}

Accessibility refers to a series of features that make a software product usable, with as little effort as possible, for users with visual, auditory, cognitive, motor, or other kinds of disabilities. Adobe is an industry leader in accessibility and supports the creation of outstanding web experiences by encouraging developers to produce rich, engaging content that is accessible to all users. Learn more about Adobe's commitment to accessibility in the [Adobe Accessibility page](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility.html){target="_blank"}.

To help meet the goal of accessibility conformance, [!DNL Journey Optimizer] follows the internationally recognized best practices in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level A and Level AA.

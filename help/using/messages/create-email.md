>The **[!UICONTROL From email]** and **[!UICONTROL From name]** are read-only and determined by the **[!UICONTROL Preset]** that has been selected when [creating the message](create-message.md).

The steps to configure an email are as follows:

1. Specify the email subject in the **[!UICONTROL Subject line]** field. To do this, click the button on the right-hand side to open the Expression editor and compose the email subject. Learn how to add personalization in [this section](../personalization/personalize.md)

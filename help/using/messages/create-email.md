Once you [created a message](get-started-content.md), use the **[!UICONTROL Email]** tab to define the settings and content for the email channel.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The **[!UICONTROL From email]** and **[!UICONTROL From name]** are read-only and determined by the **[!UICONTROL Preset]** that has been selected when [creating the message](get-started-content.md).

The steps to configure an email are as follows:

1. Specify the email subject in the **[!UICONTROL Subject line]** field. To do this, click the button on the right-hand side to open the Expression editor and compose the email subject. Learn how to add personalization in [this section](../personalization/personalize.md)

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Email Designer]** button to design your email. Learn how to design emails in [this section](../design/design-emails.md).

1. If you want to track the behavior of your recipients through openings and/or clicks on links, make sure that the **[!UICONTROL Open Tracking for email]** and **[!UICONTROL Click Tracking for email]** options are enabled. Learn more about tracking in [this section](../design/message-tracking.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Marketing-type email messages must include an [opt-out link](consent.md#opt-out-management), which is not required for transactional messages. The message category (**[!UICONTROL Marketing]** or **[!UICONTROL Transactional]**) is defined at the [message preset level](../configuration/message-presets.md#email-type) and when [creating the message](get-started-content.md#create-new-message).

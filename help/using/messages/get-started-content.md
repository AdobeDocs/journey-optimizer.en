Use [!DNL Journey Optimizer] to create and send personalized push notifications, SMS and email messages, and leverage multiple resources like assets and contents in a single place. 

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] messages are built in the context of journeys. You can:

* Use [!DNL Journey Optimizer] **email designing capabilities** to create or import responsive emails.

* Leverage **Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials** to enrich your emails, build and manage your own assets database.

* Find **Adobe Stock photos** to build your content and improve your email design.

* Enhance customers' experience by creating personalized **push notifications, SMS and email messages** based on their profile attributes.

* **Create messages** based on these contents, then publish them.

To add messages in your journeys, simply add a push, SMS or email activity in the canevas.

>Users can access, create, edit and/or publish messages depending on their product profile. Learn more about user permissions [in this section](../administration/permissions.md).

Steps to add a message in a journey are detailed below.

1. Start your journey with an [Event](../building-journeys/general-events.md) or a [Read Segment](../building-journeys/read-segment.md) activity.

1. From the **Actions** section of the palette, drag and drop an **email**, an **SMS** or a **Push** activity into the canvas.  

   ![](assets/add-a-message.png)

1. Select the message and enter a label and a description.

1. Select the message **[!UICONTROL Category]**: choose **Marketing** for commercial messages, or **Transactional** for non-commercial messages such as order confirmation, password reset notifications, or delivery information.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you defined [frequency rules](../configuration/frequency-rules.md) for a specific channel and category, they are automatically applied to the message upon selecting that channel and category. Currently only the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category is available for frequency rules.

   ![](assets/inline-message-category.png)

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >Marketing-type messages must include an [opt-out link](../messages/consent.md#opt-out-management). This is not required for transactional messages as these messages can be sent to profiles who unsubscribed from marketing communications.

1. Select the channel **[!UICONTROL Surface]** (i.e. message preset) to use to send your message. 

   A surface is a configuration which has been defined by a [System Administrator](../start/path/administrator.md). It contains all the technical parameters for sending the message, such as header parameters, subdomain, mobile apps, etc. [Learn more](../configuration/message-presets.md).

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >You must choose a valid channel surface for the selected message category and channel.
   
   You can access and modify the message's label, description and surface at any time using the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** button in the message interface.

1. Create the message content. 

   Learn detailed steps to create your message content in the following page:

   * [Create an email](create-email.md)
   * [Create a push notifications](create-push.md)
   * [Create an SMS message](create-sms.md)

## Enable Send-time optimization{#sto-in-journeys}

For email and push notifications, you can enable **[!UICONTROL Send-time optimization]**.
    
Use **[!UICONTROL Send-time optimization]** to schedule personalized send times for each user to grow the open and click rates of your messages. [Learn more](../messages/send-time-optimization.md).

## Advanced parameters{#sto-in-journeys}

Advanced parameters are read-only and hidden by default. 

To access advanced parameters, click the **[!UICONTROL Show read-only fields]** icon on the top of the messsage pane.

![](assets/show-read-only.png)

Advanced parameters are displayed at the bottom of the message pane. These parameters are defined by the [system administrator](../start/path/administrator.md) in the [surface](../configuration/message-presets.md) (or preset) associated to the message.

For push notifications, you can display the following parameters: Token, AppID, AppPlatform.

![](assets/push-adv-parameters.png)

For email, you can display the primary email address.

For specific use, you can override these values in specific contexts. To force a value, click the **Enable parameter override** icon to the right of the field. This option may be useful for example to:

* Test an email, you can add your email address. After you have published the journey, the email is sent to you.
* Refer to the email address of the subscribers of a list. Learn more in [this use case](../building-journeys/message-to-subscribers-uc.md).

Click the same icon to reset to the default parameter.

## Browse messages

When multiple messages are used in a journey, you can switch from one to another from the **Edit Content** screen.

![](assets/inline-messages-multi-content.png)

You can then [check alerts](alerts.md) and [simulate](../design/preview.md) each content from a single view.

## Duplicate a message {#duplicate-message}

You can copy an existing message from the journey canevas.

To perform this, follow the steps below:

1. Select the message you want to copy.

1. Use the **[!UICONTROL Copy]** button from the **[!UICONTROL Action]** pane.

   ![](assets/message-duplicate.png)

   The message is added to the journey canevas. All settings and configuration will be copied to the new message.

   ![](assets/message-duplicated.png)

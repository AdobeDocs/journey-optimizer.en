# Get Started with Identities {#identities-gs}

An identity is data that is unique to an entity, typically an individual person. An identity such as a login ID, ECID, or loyalty ID is referred to as a known identity.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as email address and phone number, serves to directly identify a customer. As a result, PII is used to match a customerâ€™s multiple identities across systems.

In Adobe Journey Optimizer, **Identities** link consumers across devices and channels, the result is an identity graph. The linked identity graph is used to personalize experiences based on interactions across all of your business touchpoints.

Working with identity namespaces requires an understanding of the various Adobe Experience Platform services involved. Before beginning to work with namespaces, please review the documentation for the following services:

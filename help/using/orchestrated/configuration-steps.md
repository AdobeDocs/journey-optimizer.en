This guide walks you through the process of creating a relational schema, configuring a dataset for orchestrated campaigns, ingesting data via an S3 source, and querying the ingested data in the AP platform.

In this example, the setup includes integrating two key entities, **Loyalty Transactions** and **Loyalty Rewards**, and link them to existing core entities **Recipients** and **Brands**. 

![](assets/do-not-localize/schema_admin.png)

1. [Upload DDL File](#upload-ddl)
    
    Define the relational data model for orchestrated campaigns, including the **Loyalty Transactions** and **Loyalty Rewards** entities, along with required keys and versioning attributes.

1. [Select Entities](#entities)

    Establish meaningful relationships between tables in your schema to create a cohesive and interconnected data model. 

1. [Link schema](#link-schema)

    Link the **Loyalty Transactions** entity to **Recipients**, and **Loyalty Rewards** to **Brands**, to build a connected data model that supports personalized customer journeys.

1. [Ingest Data](#ingest)

    Bring data into Adobe Experience Platform from supported sources like SFTP, cloud storage, or databases.

## Upload DDL file {#upload-ddl}

This section provides step-by-step guidance on how to create a relational schema within Adobe Experience Platform by uploading a DDL (Data Definition Language) file. Using a DDL file allows you to define the structure of your data model in advance, including tables, attributes, keys, and relationships. 

1. Log in to the AP Platform.

1. Navigate to the **Data Management** > **Schema**.

1. Click on **Create Schema**.

1. You will be prompted to select between two schema types:

    * **Standard**
    * **Relational**, used specifically for orchestrated campaigns

    ![](assets/admin_schema_1.png)

1. Select **Upload DDL file** to define an entity relationship diagram and create schemas.

    The table structure must contain:
    * At least one primary key
    * A version identifier, such as a `lastmodified` field of type `datetime` or `number`.

1. Drag and drop your DDL file and click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

1. Type-in your **[!UICONTROL Schema name]**.

1. Set up each schema and its columns, ensuring that a primary key is specified. 

    One attribute, such as `lastmodified`, must be designated as a version descriptor. This attribute, typically of type `datetime`, `long`, or `int`, is essential for ingestion processes to ensure that the dataset is updated with the latest data version.

    ![](assets/admin_schema_2.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Done]** once done.

You can now verify the table and field definitions within the canvas. [Learn more in the section below](#entities)

## Select entities {#entities}

To define logical connections between tables within your schema, follow the steps below.

1. Access the canvas view of your data model and choose the two tables you want to link

1. Click the ![](assets/do-not-localize/Smock_AddCircle_18_N.svg) button next to the Source Join, then drag and guide the arrow towards the Target Join to establish the connection.

    ![](assets/admin_schema_5.png)

1. Fill in the given form to define the link and click **Apply** once configured.

    ![](assets/admin_schema_3.png)

    **Cardinality**:

     * **1-N**: one occurrence of the source table can have several corresponding occurrences of the target table, but one occurrence of the target table can have at most one corresponding occurrence of the source table.

    * **N-1**: one occurrence of the target table can have several corresponding occurrences of the source table, but one occurrence of the source table can have at most one corresponding occurrence of the target table.

    * **1-1**: one occurrence of the source table can have at most one corresponding occurrence of the target table.

1. All links defined in your data model are represented as arrows in the canvas view. Click on an arrow between two tables to view details, make edits, or remove the link as needed.

    ![](assets/admin_schema_6.png)

1. Use the toolbar to customize and adjust your canvas.

    ![](assets/toolbar.png)

    * **Zoom in**: Magnify the canvas to see details of your data model more clearly.

    * **Zoom out**: Reduce the canvas size for a broader view of your data model.

    * **Fit view**: Adjust the zoom to fit all schemas within the visible area.

    * **Filter**: Choose which schema to display within the canvas.

    * **Force auto layout**: Automatically arrange schemas for better organization.

    * **Display map**: Toggle a minimap overlay to help navigate large or complex schema layouts more easily.

1. Click **Save** once done. This action creates the schemas and associated data sets and enables the data set for use in Orchestrated Campaigns.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Open Jobs]** to monitor the progress of the creation job. This process may take couple minutes, depending on the number of tables defined in the DDL file. 

    ![](assets/admin_schema_4.png)

## Link schema {#link-schema}

Establish a relationship between the **loyalty transactions** schema and the **Recipients** schema to associate each transaction with the correct customer record.

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Schemas]** and open your previously create **loyalty transactions**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Relationship]** from the Customer **[!UICONTROL Field properties]**.

    ![](assets/schema_1.png)

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Many-to-One]** as the relationship **[!UICONTROL Type]**.

1. Link to the existing **Recipients** schema.

    ![](assets/schema_2.png)

1. Enter a **[!UICONTROL Relationship name from current schema]** and **[!UICONTROL Relationship name from reference schema]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Apply]** to save your changes.

Continue by creating a relationship between the **loyalty rewards** schema and the **Brands** schema to associate each reward entry with the appropriate brand.

![](assets/schema_3.png)

## Ingest data {#ingest}

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Experience Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storages, databases, and many others.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Connections]** menu, access the **[!UICONTROL Sources]** menu.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Cloud storage]** category then Amazon S3 and click **[!UICONTROL Add Data]**.

    ![](assets/admin_sources_1.png)

1. Connect your S3 Account:

    * With an existing account

    * With a new account

    [Learn more in Adobe Experience Platform documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/amazon-s3#connect)

    ![](assets/admin_sources_2.png)

1. Choose your folder **[!UICONTROL Data format]**, **[!UICONTROL Delimiter]** and **[!UICONTROL Compression type]**.

1. Navigate through the connected S3 source until you locate the two folders created earlier i.e. **loyalty rewards** and **loyalty transactions**.

1. Select the folder that contains your data.
    
    Selecting a folder ensures that all current and future files with the same structure are automatically processed. Selecting a single file, however, requires manually uploading each new data increment.

    ![](assets/S3_config_2.png)

1. Choose your folder **[!UICONTROL Data format]**, **[!UICONTROL Delimiter]** and **[!UICONTROL Compression type]**. Review your sample data for accuracy, then click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

    ![](assets/S3_config_1.png)

1. Check **[!UICONTROL Enable Change data capture]** to select from datasets that are mapped to relational schemas and have both a primary key and a version descriptor defined.

1. Select your [previously created Dataset](#entities) and click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

    ![](assets/S3_config_3.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** window, verify that each source file attribute is correctly mapped with the corresponding fields in the target schema.

    Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** once done.

    ![](assets/S3_config_4.png)

1. Configure the data flow **[!UICONTROL Schedule]** based on your desired frequency.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Finish]** to create the data flow. It will execute automatically according to the defined schedule.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Connections]** menu, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** and access the **[!UICONTROL Data Flows]** tab to track flow execution, review ingested records, and troubleshoot any errors.

    ![](assets/S3_config_5.png)

<!--manual
## Create a relational schema manual


1. Log in to the AP Platform.
1. Navigate to the **Schema Management** section.
1. Click on **Create Schema**.

1. You will be prompted to select between two schema types:
    * **Standard**
    * **Relational** (used specifically for AGO campaigns)

1. Click on **Create Manual**.
1. Provide a **Schema Name** (e.g., `test_demo_ck001`).
1. Choose **Schema Type**:
    - **Record Type** (required for AGO campaigns)
    - **Time Series** (not applicable here)
1. Click **Finish** to proceed to the schema design canvas.

## Select entities and fields to import

1. In the canvas, add attributes (fields) to your schema.
1. Add a **Primary Key** (mandatory).
1. Add a **Version Descriptor** attribute (for CDC support):
    - This must be of type **DateTime** or **Numeric** (Integer, Long, Short, Byte).
    - Common example: `last_modified`

> **Why?** The **Primary Key** uniquely identifies each record, and the **Version Descriptor** tracks changes, supporting CDC (Change Data Capture) and data mirroring.

1. Mark the appropriate fields as **Primary Key** and **Version Descriptor**.
1. Click **Save**.

## 5. Creating a Dataset

1. Navigate to **Datasets**.
1. Click on **Create Dataset**.
1. Select the schema you just created.
1. Assign a **Dataset Name** (same as schema is fine).
1. Optionally, add tags (e.g., `AGO_campaigns`).
6. Ensure the checkbox **"Relational Schema"** is checked.
7. Click **Finish**.

> **Note:** Only one dataset can be created per relational schema.


## 6. Enabling the Dataset

1. Click **Enable** for the dataset.
1. Wait a few moments for the status to show **Enabled**.

> **Why?** Without enabling, the dataset cannot be used in orchestrated campaigns or ingest data.

## 7. Creating a Data Source (S3)

1. Navigate to **Sources**.
1. Click **Create Source**.
1. Choose the source type (e.g., **S3 Bucket**).
1. Provide connection details:
    - Bucket Path (optionally include subfolder path)
1. Save the source.

## 8. Preparing and Uploading Data

1. Prepare your CSV file with:
    - Column headers matching your schema attributes
    - `last_modified` column
    - `change_type` column (`U`/`DU` for upsert, `D` for delete)

> **Important:** `change_type` is required but does not need to be defined in the schema.

1. Save the file as `.csv`.

1. Upload the file to the specified folder in your S3 bucket.


## 9. Ingesting Data from S3

1. Go to **Sources** and find your S3 source.
1. Click **Add Data**.
1. Select the uploaded file.
1. Specify the file format as **CSV** and any compression type if applicable.
1. Review the data preview (ensure `change_type`, `last_modified`, and primary key are visible).
1. Click **Next**.

### Enable Change Data Capture (CDC)

- Check **Enable Change Data Capture**.
- Select the dataset enabled for AGO campaigns.

### Field Mapping

- Fields are auto-mapped (note that `change_type` is not mapped and that's expected).
- Click **Next**.

### Scheduling

- Schedule ingestion frequency (minute, hour, day, week).
- Set start time (immediate or future).
- Click **Finish** to create the data flow.

## 10. Monitoring Data Flow

1. Navigate back to **Sources > Data Flows**.
1. Wait 4–5 minutes for the first run (initial overhead).
1. Monitor:
    - Status (Started, Completed)
    - Number of records ingested
    - Errors (if any)

> **Tip:** Ingested data first lands in the **Data Lake**.

## 11. Data Replication to Data Store

The **Data Store** is updated:

- Every **15 minutes**, or

- If **Data Lake size exceeds 5MB**

This is a background replication process.


## 12. Querying the Dataset

1. Navigate to **Query Services**.
1. Click **Create Query**.
1. Example query:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM test_demo_ck001;
   ```

1. Run the query.

> **Note:** If ingestion is incomplete, query will return an error. Check data flow status.

**Response**

A successful response returns the details of the newly created personalized-offer, including id. You can use the `id` in later steps to update or delete your placement.

```json
{
    "etag": 1,
    "createdBy": "{CREATED_BY}",
    "lastModifiedBy": "{MODIFIED_BY}",
    "id": "{ID}",
    "sandboxId": "{SANDBOX_ID}",
    "createdDate": "2023-05-31T15:09:11.771Z",
    "lastModifiedDate": "2023-05-31T15:09:11.771Z",
    "createdByClientId": "{CREATED_CLIENT_ID}",
    "lastModifiedByClientId": "{MODIFIED_CLIENT_ID}""
}
```

## Limitations {#limitations}

Offer representations and some offer constraints are currently not supported with the mobile [!DNL Experience Edge] workflows, for example `Capping`. The `Capping` field value specifies the number of times an offer can be presented across all users. For more details, see [Offer eligibility rules and constraints documentation](../../../offer-library/creating-personalized-offers.md).

# Delete a personalized offer {#delete-personalized-offer}

It may occasionally be necessary to remove (DELETE) a personalized offer. This is done by performing a DELETE request to the [!DNL Offer Library] API using the id of the personalized offer you wish to delete.

**API format**

```http
DELETE /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/offers/{ID}?offer-type=personalized
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `{ENDPOINT_PATH}` | The endpoint path for persistence APIs. | `https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps/` |
| `{ID}` | The id of the entity you wish to delete. | `personalizedOffer1234` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X DELETE 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps/offers/personalizedOffer1234?offer-type=personalized' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

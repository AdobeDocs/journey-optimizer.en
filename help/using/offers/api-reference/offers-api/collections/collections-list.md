# List collections {#list-collections}

Collections are subsets of offers based on predefined conditions defined by a marketer, such as category of the offer.

You can view a list of all collections by performing a single GET request to the [!DNL Offer Library] API.

**API format**

```http
GET /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/offer-collections?{QUERY_PARAMS}
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `{ENDPOINT_PATH}` | The endpoint path for persistence APIs. | `https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps` |
| `{QUERY_PARAMS}` | Optional query parameters to filter results by. | `limit=2` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps/offer-collections?limit=2' \
-H 'Accept: *,application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
-H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
-H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
-H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

## Using query parameters {#using-query-parameters}

You can use query parameters to page and filter results when listing resources.

### Paging {#paging}

The most common query parameters for paging include:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `property`| An optional property filter: <br> <ul> - The properties are grouped by AND operation. <br><br> - Parameters can be repeated like so: property=<property-expr>[&property=<property-expr2>...] or property=<property-expr1>[,<property-expr2>...] <br><br> - Property expressions are in format [!]field[op]value, with op in [==,!=,<=,>=,<,>,~], supporting regular expressions| `property=name!=abc&property=id~.*1234.*&property=description equivalent with property=name!=abc,id~.*1234.*,description.`|
| `orderBy` | Sort results by a specific property. Adding a - before name (orderby=-name) will sort items by name in descending order (Z-A). Path expressions are in the form of dot separated paths. This parameter can be repeated like so: `orderby=field1[,-fields2,field3,...]` | `orderby=id`,`-name` |
| `limit` | Limit the number of entities returned. | `limit=5` |

**Response**

A successful response returns a list of collections that are present within the container you have access to.

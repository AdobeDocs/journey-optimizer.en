# Look up a collection {#look-up-collection}

Collections are subsets of offers based on predefined conditions defined by a marketer, such as category of the offer.

```http
GET /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/offer-collections/{ID}
```

| `{ID}` | The id of the entity you wish to look up. | `offerCollection1234` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps/offer-collections/offerCollection1234' \

# Create a collection {#create-collection}

Collections are subsets of offers based on predefined conditions defined by a marketer, such as category of the offer.

You can create a collection by making a POST request to the [!DNL Offer Library] API, while providing your container ID.

## Accept and Content-Type headers {#accept-and-content-type-headers}

The following table shows the valid values which comprise the *Content-Type* and *Accept* fields in the request header:

| Header name | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Accept | `application/vnd.adobe.platform.xcore.xdm.receipt+json; version=1` |
| Content-Type | `application/schema-instance+json; version=1;  schema="https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/offer-filter;version=0.1"` |

**API format**

```http
POST /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/offer-collections
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `{ENDPOINT_PATH}` | The endpoint path for persistence APIs.	 | `https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps/` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/offer-collections' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \

    ],
    "labels": [
        "core/C5",
        "custom/myLabel"
    ]
}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns information on the newly created collection, including placement `@id`. You can use the id in later steps to update or delete your collection. You can use your unique placement id in later tutorials to create decisions, decision rules, and fallback offers.

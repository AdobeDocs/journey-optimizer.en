Collections are subsets of offers based on predefined conditions defined by a marketer, such as category of the offer.

You can create a collection by making a POST request to the [!DNL Offer Library] API.

## Accept and Content-Type headers {#accept-and-content-type-headers}

The following table shows the valid values which comprise the *Content-Type* field in the request header:

| Header name | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Content-Type | `application/json` |

**API format**

```http
POST /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/offer-collections
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `{ENDPOINT_PATH}` | The endpoint path for persistence APIs. | `https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps/` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps/offer-collections' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
-H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
-H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
-H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
-d '{
    "name": "Test Collection with tags",
    "filterType": "any-tags",
    "ids": [
        "tag1234"
    ],
    "labels": [
        "core/C5",
        "custom/myLabel"
    ]
}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns information on the newly created collection, including its `id`. You can use the `id` in later steps to update or delete your collection or in a later tutorial to create a decision.

```json
{
    "etag": 1,
    "createdBy": "{CREATED_BY}",
    "lastModifiedBy": "{MODIFIED_BY}",
    "id": "{ID}",
    "sandboxId": "{SANDBOX_ID}",
    "createdDate": "2023-05-31T15:09:11.771Z",
    "lastModifiedDate": "2023-05-31T15:09:11.771Z",
    "createdByClientId": "{CREATED_CLIENT_ID}",
    "lastModifiedByClientId": "{MODIFIED_CLIENT_ID}"
}
```

# Create a collection {#create-collection}

Collections are subsets of offers based on predefined conditions defined by a marketer, such as category of the offer.

You can create a collection by making a POST request to the [!DNL Offer Library] API, while providing your container ID.

## Accept and Content-Type headers {#accept-and-content-type-headers}

The following table shows the valid values which comprise the *Content-Type* and *Accept* fields in the request header:

| Header name | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Accept | `application/vnd.adobe.platform.xcore.xdm.receipt+json; version=1` |
| Content-Type | `application/schema-instance+json; version=1;  schema="https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/offer-filter;version=0.1"` |

**API format**

```http
POST /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/{CONTAINER_ID}/instances
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `{ENDPOINT_PATH}` | The endpoint path for persistence APIs. | `https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps/` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/xcore/e0bd8463-0913-4ca1-bd84-6309134ca1f6/instances' \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.adobe.platform.xcore.xdm.receipt+json; version=1' \

  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \

        "xdm:name": "Offer Collection 1",
        "xdm:filterType": "anyTags",
        "xdm:ids": [
            "xcore:tag:124e147572cd7866"
        ]
    }'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns information on the newly created collection, including its `id`. You can use the `id` in later steps to update or delete your collection or in a later tutorial to create a decision.

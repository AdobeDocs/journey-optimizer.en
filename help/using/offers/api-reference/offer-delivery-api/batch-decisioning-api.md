# Deliver offers using the [!DNL Batch Decisioning] API {#deliver-offers-batch}

The [!DNL Batch Decisioning] API allows organizations to use decisioning functionality for all profiles in a given audience in one call. The offer content for each profiles in the audience is placed in an Adobe Experience Platform dataset where it is available for custom batch workflows.

With the [!DNL Batch Decisioning] API, you can populate a dataset with the best offers for all profiles in an Adobe Experience Platform audience for decision scopes. For example, an organization may want to run [!DNL Batch Decisioning] so they can send offers to a message delivery vendor. Those offers are then used as content that is sent out for batch message delivery to the same audience of users. 

To do this, the organization would:

* Run the [!DNL Batch Decisioning] API, which contains two requests:
    
    1. A **Batch POST request** to start a workload to batch process offer selections.  
    
    2. A **Batch GET request** to get batch workload status.

* Export the dataset to the message delivery vendor API. 

<!-- (Refer to the [export jobs endpoint documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/api/export-jobs.html) to learn more about exporting audiences.) -->

>[!NOTE]
>
>Batch decisioning can also be performed using Journey Optimizer interface. For more information, refer to [this section](../../batch-delivery.md), which provides information on global prerequisites and limitations to take inbto account when using batch decisioning.

* **The number of running batch jobs per dataset**: Up to five batch jobs can be run at a time, per dataset. Any other batch requests with the same output dataset are added to the queue. A queued job is picked up to process once the previous job has finished running. 
* **Frequency capping**: A batch runs off of the profile snapshot that occurs once a day. The [!DNL Batch Decisioning] API caps the frequency and always loads profiles from the most recent snapshot.

## Getting started {#getting-started}

Before using this API, make sure you complete the following pre-requisite steps.

### Prepare the decision {#prepare-decision}

To prepare one or more decisions, make sure you have created a dataset, an audience, and a decision. Those prerequisites are detailed in [this section](../../batch-delivery.md).

### API requirements {#api-requirements}

All [!DNL Batch Decisioning] requests require the following headers in addition to the ones referred to in the [Decision Management API developer guide](../getting-started.md):

* `Content-Type`: `application/json`
* `x-request-id`: A unique string that identifies the request.
* `x-sandbox-name`: The sandbox name.
* `x-sandbox-id`: The sandbox ID.

## Start a batch process {#start-a-batch-process}

To start a workload to batch process decisions, make a POST request to the `/workloads/decisions` endpoint.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Detailed information on batch jobs' processing time are available in [this section](../../batch-delivery.md).

# Get started with offer catalog export {#export-catalog}

>[!TIP]
>
>Decisioning, [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer]'s new decisioning capability, is now available via the code-based experience and email channels! [Learn more](../../experience-decisioning/gs-experience-decisioning.md)

Journey Optimizer allows you to automatically export your offer catalog to Adobe Experience Platform.

The export creates one dataset for each object of your Offer Library (see [Access exported datasets](../export-catalog/access-dataset.md)). It includes:

* Personalized offers
* Fallback offers
* Placements
* Decisions

Each time one of these objects is modified in the Offer Library, a new export job is automatically executed to update the datasets.

>[!NOTE]

>This feature is enabled by default. You can start using it without any additional activation steps. Once enabled, export jobs will be automated and will require no action from your side.

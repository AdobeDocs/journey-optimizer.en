# Grant access to Decision management {#granting-acess-to-decision-management}

Permissions to access and use the offer decisioning capabilities are managed using the [Adobe Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/managing/user-guide.html){target="_blank"}. 

To grant access to the  Decision Management functionality, you need to create a **[!UICONTROL Product profile]** and assign the corresponding permissions to your users. Learn more on managing [!DNL Journey Optimizer] users and permissions in [this section](../../administration/permissions.md).

The permissions specific to Decision Management are listed in [this section](../../administration/high-low-permissions.md#manage-decisioning).

<!--If you are a [!DNL Journey Optimizer] user leveraging the **Decision Management** functionality, you need to have the [Decision management permissions](../../administration/high-low-permissions.md#decisions-permissions) enabled to acces all related capabilities. Learn more on managing [!DNL Journey Optimizer] users and permissions in [this section](../../administration/permissions.md).

If you are an [Adobe Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/home.html){target="_blank"} user leveraging the **Offer Decisioning** application service, follow the steps [below](#granting-acess-to-offer-decisioning) to grant access to [!DNL Offer Decisioning].

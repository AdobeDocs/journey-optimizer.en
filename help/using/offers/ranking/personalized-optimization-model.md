## Overview {#overview}

By leveraging the state-of-the-art technologies in supervised machine learning and deep learning, Auto-personalization allows a business user (marketer) to define business goals and utilizes their customer data to train business-oriented models to serve personalized offers and maximize KPIs.

## Key Model Assumptions and Limitations {#key}

In order to maximize the advantage of using auto-personalization, there are some key assumptions and limitations to be aware of. 

* Offers are different enough so that different users have different preferences in different offers. If offers are too similar, it won't make much difference which offer is served to an end user. 
* User traffic composition is stable. If user traffic composition changes dramatically during model training and predicting, model performance could degrade. For example, suppose in model training phase, only data for users in segment A is available, but the trained model is used to generate predictions for users in segment B, then model performance could be impacted.
* Offers performances do not change dramatically.

## How It Works {#how}

Auto-personalization learns complex feature interactions between offers, users' information and contextual information to recommend personalized offers to end users. Specifically, there are two phases, offline model training and online inference. In the offline model training phase, a model is trained by learning and memorizing feature interactions in historical data. In the online inference phase, candidates offers are ranked based on real-time scores generated by the model. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering techniques, which is hard to include features for users and offers, auto-personalization is a deep learning based recommendation method, and is able to include and learn complex and nonlinear feature interaction patterns. 

Here is a simplified example to illustrate the basic idea behind auto-personalization. Suppose we have a dataset which stores historical interactions between users and offers, which is shown in Figure 1. There are two offers, offer_1 and offer_2, two features, feature_1 and feature_2, and a response column. The value of feature_1, feature_2 and response is either 0 or 1. When we look at the blue boxes and orange boxes in Figure 1, we can find that for offer_1, the responses are more likely to be 1 when feature_1 and feature_2 have same values, while for offer_2, the labels are more likely to be 1 when feature_1 is 0 and feature_2 is 1. We can also see that in the red box, offer_1 is served when feature_1 is 0 and feature_2 is 1, and response is 0. Based on the pattern we see in orange boxes, when feature_1 is 0 and feature_2 is 1, offer_2 is probably a better recommendation. Basically, this is the idea of learning and memorizing historical feature interactions and applying them to generate personalized predictions.

## Cold-start Problem {#cold-start}

Cold-start problem occurs when there isn't enough data to make recommendation. For auto-personalization, there are two types of cold-start problems.

* When there is no historical data, offers will be randomly served for a period of time to collect data.
* When there is data of some offers, but a new offer needs to be scored, a prediction is generated by using some features other than offer ids.

## Re-training {#re-training}

Models will be re-trained to learn latest feature interactions and mitigate model performance degradation.

## Lift Measurement {#lift}

Lift is defined as: Lift = (Auto_personalization_KPI - Default_method_KPI) / Default_method_KPI

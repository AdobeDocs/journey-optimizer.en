# Get started with rankings {#create-fallback-offers}

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to use rankings to ranks offers to display for a given profile:

* **Ranking formulas** allow you to define rules that will determine which offer should be presented first for a given placement, rather than taking into account the offers' priority scores. [Learn more about ranking formulas](create-ranking-formulas.md)

* **AI models** allow you to use trained model systems that will leverage multiple data points to determine which offer should be presented first for a given placement. [Learn more about AI models](ai-models.md)

Once a ranking formula or an AI model has been created, you can assign it to a placement in a decision. For more on this, see [Configure offers selection in decisions](../offer-activities/configure-offer-selection.md).

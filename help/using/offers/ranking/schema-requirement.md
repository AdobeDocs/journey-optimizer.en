# Configure events capture {#schema-requirements}

At this point, you must have:

* created the AI model,
* defined which type of event you want to capture - offer displayed (impression) and/or offer clicked (conversion),
* and in which dataset you want to collect the event data.

Now each time an offer is displayed and/or clicked, you want the corresponding event to be automatically captured by the **[!UICONTROL Experience Event - Proposition Interactions]** field group using the [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/web-sdk-faq.html#what-is-adobe-experience-platform-web-sdk%3F){target="_blank"} or Mobile SDK.

To be able to send in event types (offer displayed or offer clicked), you must set the correct value for each event type in an experience event that is sent into Adobe Experience Platform. Below are the schema requirements you need to implement into your JavaScript code:

### Offer displayed scenario

**Event type:** `decisioning.propositionDisplay`
**Source:** Web.sdk/Alloy.js (`sendEvent command -> xdm : {eventType, interactionMixin}`) or batch ingestion
+++**Sample payload:**

```
{
    "@id": "a7864a96-1eac-4934-ab44-54ad037b4f2b",
    "xdm:timestamp": "2020-09-26T15:52:25+00:00",
    "xdm:eventType": "decisioning.propositionDisplay",
    "https://ns.adobe.com/experience/decisioning/propositions":
    [
        {
            "xdm:items":
            [
                {
                    "xdm:id": "personalized-offer:f67bab756ed6ee4",
                },
                {
                    "xdm:id": "personalized-offer:f67bab756ed6ee5",
                }
            ],
            "xdm:id": "3cc33a7e-13ca-4b19-b25d-c816eff9a70a", //decision event id - taken from experience event for “nextBestOffer”
            "xdm:scope": "scope:12cfc3fa94281acb", //decision scope id - taken from experience event for “nextBestOffer”
        }
    ]
}
```

### Offer clicked scenario

**Event type:** `decisioning.propositionInteract`
**Source:** Web.sdk/Alloy.js (`sendEvent command -> xdm : {eventType, interactionMixin}`) or batch ingestion
+++**Sample payload:**

```
{
    "@id": "a7864a96-1eac-4934-ab44-54ad037b4f2b",
    "xdm:timestamp": "2020-09-26T15:52:25+00:00",
    "xdm:eventType": "decisioning.propositionInteract",
    "https://ns.adobe.com/experience/decisioning/propositions":
    [
        {
            "xdm:items":
            [
                {
                    "xdm:id": "personalized-offer:f67bab756ed6ee4"
                },
                {
                    "xdm:id": "personalized-offer:f67bab756ed6ee5"
                },
            ],
            "xdm:id": "3cc33a7e-13ca-4b19-b25d-c816eff9a70a", //decision event id
            "xdm:scope": "scope:12cfc3fa94281acb", //decision scope id
        }
    ]
}
```

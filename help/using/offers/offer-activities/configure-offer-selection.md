# Configure offers selection in decisions {#offers-selection-in-decisions}

If several offers are eligible for a given placement, you can choose the method that will select the best offer for each profile when configuring a decision. You can rank offers by:
* Offer priority
* Ranking formula
* [AI ranking](#use-ranking-strategy) (in early access for select users only)

## Offer priority {#offer-priority}

By default, when several offers are eligible for a given placement in a decision, the offers with the highest **priority** will be delivered to the customers first.

Offers' priority scores are assigned when creating an offer. Learn how to create a personalized offer in [this section](../offer-library/creating-personalized-offers.md).

## Ranking formula {#assign-ranking-formula}

In addition to offer priority, Journey Optimizer allows you to create **ranking formulas**. These are formulas that determine which offer should be presented first for a given placement, rather than taking into account the offers' priority scores.

For example, you can boost the priority of all offers where the end date is less than 24 hours from now, or boost offers from the "running" category if the profile's point of interest is "running".

Learn how to create a ranking formula in [this section](../offer-library/create-ranking-formulas.md).

Once a ranking formula has been created, you can assign it to a placement in a decision. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Create a decision or edit an existing one. See [Create decisions](../offer-activities/create-offer-activities.md).

1. Add the placements that will contain your offers. See [Create placements](../offer-library/creating-placements.md).

1. For each placement, add a collection. See [Create collections](../offer-library/creating-collections.md).

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Ranking formula]** as the ranking method, then click **[!UICONTROL Add ranking]**.

1. Select the desired ranking formula, then click **[!UICONTROL Select]**.

    ![](../../assets/ranking-selection.png)

The ranking formula is now associated to the placement.

If multiple offers are eligible to be presented in this placement, the decision will use the ranking formula's formula to calculate which offer to deliver first.

## AI ranking {#use-ranking-strategy}

<!--If you are an [Adobe Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/home.html){target="_blank"} user leveraging the **Offer Decisioning** application service,-->

You can also use an trained model system that automatically ranks offers to display for a given profile by selecting a ranking strategy. Learn how to create a ranking strategy in [this section](../offer-library/create-ranking-strategies.md).

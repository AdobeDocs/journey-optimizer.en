<p>For more information on collections, refer to the <a href="building-journeys/collections.md">detailed documentation</a>. </p>
<p>The filter and intersect functions have been added to the list of functions available in the advanced expression editor. This offers more possibilities for collection filtering and comparing.</p>

**Journeys**

* The schemas and datasets that have been created during provisioning for step events are now in read-only mode.

**Personalization**

* Auto-completion of expressions improves customer experience, making it easier to quickly pull in different attributes without having to use the search. Auto-completion becomes much more important when working with an inline expression editor. The in-line expression editor enables customers to work with personalization in a variety of text fields without having to jump into the full expression editor modal.

### Improvements

**Journeys**

* **Recents** - The display of recents elements from Adobe Journey Optimizer home page is now extended to additional business objects. With this update, shortcuts to your recently accessed include Messages, Journeys, Segments, Schemas, Datasets, Data Sources, Events, Actions, Sources, and Destinations.

**Content Design**

* **Background** - Background images are now supported in live preview. [Learn more](preview.md)

[Learn more](message-tracking.md#one-click-opt-out-link)

**Personalization**

* **Expression Editor** - You can now easily add a fall-back value when defining personalization: when personalization field is empty for a profile, the fall-back value will display. [Learn more](personalization/functions/helpers.md)

**Email configuration**

* **Allowed list** - The allowed list can now be enabled and disabled on a non-production sandbox through an API call. [Learn more](allow-list.md#enable-allow-list)
* **Navigation** - The suppression list, which was accessible under the **Administration > Channels > Email configuration > General** menu, has been moved to the new **Suppression list** submenu, which gathers all related capabilities for easier access. [Learn more](configuration/manage-suppression-list.md#access-suppression-list)

**Decision management**

* The way you add and configure representations when creating an offer has been updated for improved user experience. In particular, the Asset library is now displayed only when you define image-type content for a representation. [Learn more](offers/offer-library/creating-personalized-offers.md#representations)

### Fixes 

* Fixed an accessibility issue in message tab navigation.
* Fixed a localization issue in the email designer labels.
* Fixed an issue when selecting more than one node in a journey and clicking 'Delete' on the property panel.

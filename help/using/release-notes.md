For example, you may set the retry period to 24 hours for a password reset transactional message containing a link valid for only a day. [Learn more](documentation-updates.md)
* **Suppression list** - Adding email addresses and domains into the suppression list is now available from the user interface, either one by one, either in bulk mode through a CSV file upload. [Learn more](documentation-updates.md)

* **Message preset** - You can now find out the reason why a message preset creation failed through a more explicit warning in the user interface. [Learn more](documentation-updates.md)
* **Navigation** - The suppression list, which was accessible under the **Channels > Email configuration > General** menu, has been moved to the **Channels > Email configuration > Suppression list** menu for easier access.

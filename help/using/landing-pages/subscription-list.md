# Create a subscription list {#create-subscription-list}

## What is a subscription list?

Subscription service refers to marketing goods and services provided to customers who have opted-in to receive communications on a specific subject, event, etc. on an ongoing basis. A subscription service can be a newsletter “Running series”, an event “Summit 2021” or a Webinar.

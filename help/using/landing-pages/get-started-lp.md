A landing page is a standalone web page that a user is directed to after clicking through from an email, a website, an ad, or any other digital location.

<!--The landing page is driven toward a business goal like joining a subscription list, buying products, get to know more, etc. If the user takes that desired action, the landing page has converted. Landing pages often contain online forms that are used by marketers to acquire new consumers or get to know better their existing customers and nurture them.-->

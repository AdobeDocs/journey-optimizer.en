A landing page is a standalone web page that a user is directed to after clicking through from an email, a website, an ad, or any other digital location.

<!--The landing page is driven toward a business goal like joining a subscription list, buying products, get to know more, etc. If the user takes that desired action, the landing page has converted. Landing pages often contain online forms that are used by marketers to acquire new consumers or get to know better their existing customers and nurture them.-->

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to create and design landing pages to direct your users to online forms where they can opt in or opt out from receiving your communications, or subscribe to a specific service such as a newsletter.

<!--Landing pages are online forms that are used by marketers to capture information on audiences, offer subscriptions to a service, display data and grow your database. These can also be used for acquiring or updating existing profiles.-->

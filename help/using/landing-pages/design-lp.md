# Design the landing page content {#design-lp}

To start creating content for your landing [primary page](create-lp.md#configure-primary-page) or [subpage](create-lp.md#configure-subpages), hover the mouse over your page content and click **[!UICONTROL Open Designer]**. You can also click the corresponding button from the right palette.

From there, you can:

* **Design your landing page from scratch** through the content designer's interface, and leverage images from [Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials](../design/assets-essentials.md). Learn how to design your content <!--or use built-in templates--> [in this section](../design/create-email-content.md).

* **Code or paste raw HTML** directly into the content designer. Learn how to code your own content [in this section](../design/code-content.md).

* **Import existing HTML content** from a file or a .zip folder. Learn how to import content [in this section](../design/existing-content.md).

* **Use a saved landing page template** created in [!DNL Journey Optimizer]. [Learn more](#work-with-templates)

>The landing page content designer is mostly similar to the email designer. Learn more on [designing content with [!DNL Journey Optimizer]](../design/design-emails.md).

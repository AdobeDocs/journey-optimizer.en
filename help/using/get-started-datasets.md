# Get Started with Datasets {#datasets-gs}

All data that is ingested into Adobe Experience Platform is persisted within the Data Lake as datasets. A dataset is a storage and management construct for a collection of data, typically a table, that contains a schema (columns) and fields (rows).

Learn how to create datasets in [this documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/catalog/datasets/overview.html){target="_blank"}.

Adding data to Adobe Experience Platform is the foundation to building a Profile. You will then be able to leverage profiles in [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer]. First define schemas, use ETL tools to prepare and standardize your data, then create datasets based on your schemas.

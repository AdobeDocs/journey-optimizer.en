All the templates that were created on the current sandbox - either from a journey or a campaign using the **[!UICONTROL Save as template]** option, either from the **[!UICONTROL Content Templates]** menu - are displayed. [Learn how to create templates](#create-content-templates)

You can sort content templates by:
* Type
* Channel
* Creation or modification date
* Tags - [Learn more on tags](../start/search-filter-categorize.md#tags)

You can also choose to display only the items that yourself created or modified.

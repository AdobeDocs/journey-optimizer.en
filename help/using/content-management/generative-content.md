Once you have created and personalized your messages, take your content to the next level with the Content assistant. 

By leveraging the Content assistant, you have the opportunity to optimize your message's impact by experimenting with different content. Each variant is considered as a unique Treatment, to measure and compare which content effectively generates more clicks.

In this particular example, learn how to send an engaging Push notification using Content Experiment. Follow these steps:

1. Use the Generation assistant to change the **[!UICONTROL Title]**.

    Next to your **[!UICONTROL Header]** field, click **[!UICONTROL Edit with Text generation assistant]**.

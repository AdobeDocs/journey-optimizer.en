Once you have created and personalized your messages, take your content to the next level with the Content assistant. 

By leveraging the Content assistant, you have the opportunity to optimize your message's impact by experimenting with different main titles. Each variant is considered as a unique Treatment, to measure and compare which title effectively generates more clicks.

In this particular example, learn how to send an engaging Push notification using Content Experiment. Follow these steps:

1. Create your message and add Content experimentation. Learn more about Content Experimentation in [this section](../campaigns/content-experiment.md)

1. After configuring your campaign and experiment, click **[!UICONTROL Create content]** and personalize your message content as needed.

1. For your second **[!UICONTROL Treatment]**, use the Generation assistant to change the Title.

    Next to your **[!UICONTROL Header]** field, click **[!UICONTROL Edit with Text generation assistant]**.

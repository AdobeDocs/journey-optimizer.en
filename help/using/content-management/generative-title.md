# Title generation with Generative Sensei {#title-generative-sensei}

Once you have created and personalized your Emails, In-app messages, SMS, Push notifications, or Web pages, take your content to the next level with Generative Sensei. In this particular example, we will focus on sending an engaging In-app message using Content Experiment.

By leveraging Generative Sensei, you have the opportunity to optimize your message's impact by experimenting with different main titles. Each variant will be treated as a unique Treatment, to measure and compare which title effectively generates more clicks.

1. Create your delivery and add Content experimentation for this delivery. [Learn more on Experimentation](../campaigns/content-experiment.md)

1. After configuring your delivery and experiment, click **[!UICONTROL Create content]** and personalize your deliveries as needed.

1. For your second **[!UICONTROL Treatment]**, we will use the Generation assistant to change the Title.

    Next to your **[!UICONTROL Title]** field, click **[!UICONTROL Edit with Text generation assistant]**.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL User action]** menu, select the **[!UICONTROL Text refinement]**:

    * **[!UICONTROL Summarize]**: Use this option to shorten a text and keep the essential.
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Elaborate]**: Use this option to expand your content with additional creative variants from Generative Sensei.

1. Choose the tone of your variants with the **[!UICONTROL Change tone of voice]** menu. 

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Free form]** menu, you can also choose to provide a prompt to better fine-tune your results.

1. Once you found the appropriate variant, click **[!UICONTROL User variant]** then **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.

1. After defining your message content, click the **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** button to control the rendering of your delivery, and check personalization settings with test profiles. [Learn more](../email/preview.md)

1. When your content experiment is ready, from your Campaign summary page, you can click **[!UICONTROL Review to activate]** to display a summary of the campaign. Alerts display if any parameter is incorrect or missing.

1. Before launching your campaign, double-check that all configurations are correct, and then click on **[!UICONTROL Activate]**.

After successfully configuring your experimentation and campaign, you can keep track of your delivery's progress using the Campaign report. [Learn more](../reports/campaign-global-report.md#experimentation-report)

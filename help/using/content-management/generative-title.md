# Title generation with the Content assistant {#title-content-assistant}

Once you have created and personalized your delivery, take your content to the next level with the Content assistant. In this particular example, we will focus on sending an engaging Push notification using Content Experiment.

By leveraging the Content assistant, you have the opportunity to optimize your message's impact by experimenting with different main titles. Each variant will be treated as a unique Treatment, to measure and compare which title effectively generates more clicks.

1. Create your delivery and add Content experimentation for this delivery. [Learn more on Experimentation](../campaigns/content-experiment.md)

1. After configuring your delivery and experiment, click **[!UICONTROL Create content]** and personalize your deliveries as needed.

1. For your second **[!UICONTROL Treatment]**, we will use the Generation assistant to change the Title.

    Next to your **[!UICONTROL Header]** field, click **[!UICONTROL Edit with Text generation assistant]**.

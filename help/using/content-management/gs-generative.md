Use the AI Assistant in Journey Optimizer to optimize your message's impact by experimenting with different main titles and images. Generate multiple variant and build an experiment to compare them. Leveraging Journey Optimizer Content Experiment, you can define multiple message treatments in order to measure which one performs best for your target audience. You can choose to vary the delivery content, or subject. The message audience is randomly allocated to each treatment to determine which one works best in terms of the specified metric. Learn more about Content Experiment in [this section](../campaigns/content-experiment.md).

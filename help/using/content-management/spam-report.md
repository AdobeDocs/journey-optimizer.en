When editing or previewing your content, the **[!UICONTROL Spam report]** option provides a scoring and advice to improve scores for each individual item that is listed.

This allows you to determine whether a message runs the risk of being considered as spam by the anti-spam tools used upon receipt, and to take actions if this is not the case.

>The Spam report only provides indications and warnings. Note that you are not prevented from sending messages if the Spam report indicates that your content is considered as spam. It is your choice to act upon the score and suggested improvements.

To use the **[!UICONTROL Spam report]** feature, follow the steps below.

<!--For example spam scoring tool can tell that there are too many Images compared to the text. Retailers tend to do this even though the spam score gets worse because the content is more engaging.-->

## About content preview and test {#about}

Once your content has been defined, you can use test profiles to [preview](preview.md) its content before sending the message. This is a crucial step to ensure that it is accurate but also free of errors both in content and personalization settings.

In addition, you can also [send test deliveries](proofs.md) (proofs) of your email messages to specific recipients or subscribers for testing and validation, and [check their rendering](rendering.md) in popular desktop, mobile and web-based clients.

All these actions can be performed using the **[!UICONTROL Simulate Content]** button, which is accessible from the edit content screen of your message, or from the email and web designers for the email and web channels.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>When previewing a message or sending proofs, only profile personalization data is displayed. Personalization based on context data, such as event information, can only be tested in the context of a journey. Learn how to test personalization in [this use case](../personalization/personalization-use-case.md).

# Get started with content templates {#content-templates}
  
For an accelerated and improved design process, you can create standalone templates to easily reuse custom content across [!DNL Journey Optimizer] campaigns and journeys.

This functionality enables content-oriented users to work on templates outside campaigns or journeys. Marketing users can then reuse and adapt these standalone content templates inside their own journeys or campaigns.

For example, a user within your company is in charge of content only, and therefore has no access to campaigns or journeys. However, this user can create an email template that your organization's marketers will be able to select for use in all emails as a starting point.

You can create content templates for the Email, Push, In-App, SMS, and Direct Mail channels.

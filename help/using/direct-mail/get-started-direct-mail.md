# Get started with direct mail {#create-direct}

Direct mail is an offline channel that allows you to personalize and generate the extraction files required by third-party direct mail providers to send mail to your customers. 

When creating a direct mail campaign, Journey Optimizer automatically generates a file containing all the targeted profiles and selected data, such as postal addresses and profile attributes. This file is sent to the server of your choice so that it is accessible by your chosen third-party direct mail provider, who will handle the actual mailing process for you.

You will need to work with your chosen third-party direct mail provider to obtain any required consents from you customers, if applicable, so that your customers can receive mail from you.

Your use of mailing services is subject to additional terms and conditions from the applicable third-party direct mail provider.  Adobe does not control and is not responsible for your use of third-party products. For any issues or requests for assistance related to the mailing of your direct mail campaign, contact your chosen third-party direct mail provider.

The main steps to send direct mail messages are as follows:

## What is Customer Journey Management?{#about-cjm}

Customer Journey Management helps companies deliver connected, contextual, and personalized experiences to their customers. The customer journey is the entire process of a customer’s interactions with the brand, from the first moment of contact until the customer leaves. It starts with the awareness phase, where the customer learns about the brand and starts engaging. The customer will then further interact with the brand, visit online and physical sites, and make purchases, send messages or post reviews.

Customer Journey Management follows customers through all the stages of the customer journey and gives companies the insights they need to interact with high-value customers at the most important touchpoints. It helps companies in the process of figuring out the best way to interact with customers at each stage of a customer's journey.

Leveraging Customer Journey Management capabilities, enriched with Messages and Read Segment capabilities, Customer Journey Management enables brands to deliver omni-channel individualized experiences in real-time and at scale with a set of intelligent, extensible, API-first capabilities, and are easy to try, buy and realize value​. This set of new capabilities bring real-time journeys, modern authoring and high-speed delivery capabilities.​

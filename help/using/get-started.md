## What is [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer]?{#about-cjm}

[!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] helps companies deliver connected, contextual, and personalized experiences to their customers. The customer journey is the entire process of a customer’s interactions with the brand, from the first moment of contact until the customer leaves. It starts with the awareness phase, where the customer learns about the brand and starts engaging. The customer will then further interact with the brand, visit online and physical sites, and make purchases, send messages or post reviews.

[!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] is built natively on the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] and combines a unified, real-time customer profile, an API-first open framework, centralized offer decisioning, and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for personalization and optimization. Journey Optimizer allows brands to intelligently determine the next best interaction with scale, speed, and flexibility across the entire customer journey. With [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer], companies can create and deliver both scheduled marketing campaigns (such as weekly promotions for a retail store) and tailored individual communications (like a push notification for an item that a loyalty app customer may have looked at that was previously out of stock) within the same application.

## Use cases

* Marketers can use [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] to send both individualized communications as well as audience-based batch communications. For example, a clothing store typically sends post-purchase surveys to all customers who have purchased products in the last week. Due to inclement weather, a few shipments experienced delays. Seeing which customers have not received their shipments, the clothing store can exclude them from the scheduled customer satisfaction send and instead send a personalized email apologizing for the delay and offering a discount code with product recommendations based on the customer’s past purchases.
    
    Marketers can also use the application to send real-time behavior-based communications. For example, the same retailer would be able to engage a loyal customer who pulls into the store parking lot in real time by sending them a push notification about a sweater that is back in stock in the customer’s size.

* Non-marketers such as operations teams and customer support who are engaged in the customer experience can use [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] to manage a variety of tasks such as operational notifications or even to monitor the onboarding process. Take for example, an amusement park where park visitors download a mobile app as part of their park experience. Maintenance staff can use [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] to notify park visitors of rides that are currently closed due to maintenance.

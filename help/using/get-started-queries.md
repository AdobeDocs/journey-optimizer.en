# Get Started with Queries {#queries-gs}

Query Editor is an interactive tool provided by Adobe Experience Platform Query Service, which allows you to write, validate, and run queries for customer experience data within [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] user interface. 

Query Editor supports developing queries for analysis and data exploration, and allows you to run interactive queries for development purposes as well as non-interactive queries to populate [datasets](get-started-datasets.md).

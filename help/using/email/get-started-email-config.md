# Get started with email configuration {#get-starte-email-config}

To be able to send emails through journeys and campaigns in [!DNL Journey Optimizer], you need to go through a number of configuration steps.

1. To ensure optimal deliverability and protect your reputation, start by delegating to Adobe the subdomains you are going to use to send your emails with [!DNL Journey Optimizer]. These subdomains will determine elements such as the web pages to be tracked and the mirror page URLs. [Learn more](../configuration/about-subdomain-delegation.md)

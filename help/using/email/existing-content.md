[!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to import existing HTML content to design your emails. This content can be:

* An **HTML file** with an incorporated style sheet;
* A **.zip folder** including an HTML file, the style sheet (.css) and images.

    >There are no constraints on the .zip file structure. However, references must be relative and fit with the tree structure of the .zip folder.

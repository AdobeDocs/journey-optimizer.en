# Import your email content {#existing-content}

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to import existing HTML content to design your emails. This content can be:

* An **HTML file** with an incorporated style sheet;
* A **.zip folder** including an HTML file, the style sheet (.css) and images.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >There are no constraints on the .zip file structure. However, references must be relative and fit with the tree structure of the .zip folder.

To import a file containing HTML content, follow the steps below:

1. From the Email Designer home page, select **[!UICONTROL Import HTML]**.

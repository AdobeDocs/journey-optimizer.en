Use Adobe Journey Optimizer Designer to easily define the structure of your contents. By adding and moving structural elements with simple drag-and-drop actions, you can design the shape of your contents within seconds.

To start building your content, follow the steps below:

1. From the Designer home page, select the **[!UICONTROL Design from scratch]** option.

1. Start designing your content by drag and dropping **[!UICONTROL Structures]** into the canvas to define the layout of your email.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Stacking columns is not compatible with all email programs. When not supported, columns will not be stacked.

    <!--Once placed in the email, you cannot move nor remove your components unless there is already a content component or a fragment placed inside. This is not true in AJO - TBC?-->

1. Add as many **[!UICONTROL Structures]** as needed and edit their settings in the dedicated pane on the right.

    Select the **[!UICONTROL n:n column]** component to define the number of columns of your choice (between 3 and 10). You can also define the width of each column by moving the arrows at the bottom of each column.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Each column size cannot be under 10% of the total width of the structure component. You cannot remove a column that is not empty.

1. Expand the **[!UICONTROL Contents]** section and add as many elements as you need into one or more structure components. [Learn more about content components](content-components.md)

1. Each component can be further customized using the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** or **[!UICONTROL Style]** tabs in the right menu. For example, you can change the text style, padding or margin of each component. [Learn more about alignment and padding](alignment-and-padding.md)

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Asset picker]**, you can directly select assets stored in the **[!UICONTROL Assets library]**. [Learn more about asset management](assets-essentials.md)

    Double-click the folder which contains your assets. Drag and drop them into a structure component.

1. Insert personalization fields to customize your content from profiles attributes, Segment memberships, Contextual attributes, and more. [Learn more about content personalization](../personalization/personalize.md)

    ![](assets/email_designer_personalization.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Enable condition content]** to add dynamic content and adapt the content to the targeted profiles based on conditional rules. [Get started with dynamic content](../personalization/get-started-dynamic-content.md)

    ![](assets/email_designer_dynamic-content.png)

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Links]** tab from the left pane to display all the URLs of your content that will be tracked. You can modify their **[!UICONTROL Tracking Type]** or **[!UICONTROL Label]** and add **[!UICONTROL Tags]** if needed. [Learn more about links and tracking](message-tracking.md)

    ![](assets/email_designer_links.png)

1. If needed, you can further personalize your content by clicking **[!UICONTROL Switch to code editor]** from the top **More** button. [Learn more about the code editor](code-content.md)

    >[!CAUTION]
    >
    >You cannot revert back to the visual designer for this content after switching to the code editor.

1. Once your content is ready, click the **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** button to check rendering. You can choose the desktop or mobile view. [Learn more about previewing your email](preview.md)

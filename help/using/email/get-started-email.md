>If this is your first time creating an email, make sure the email channel has been configured. [Learn more](email-settings.md)

Use [!DNL Journey Optimizer] to send email messages to your customers. You can create, personalize, and preview messages in the Email Designer.

Email deliveries can be created:

* In a **Journey**: once you added an **[!UICONTROL Email]** activity to your journey, and defined basic settings, use the **[!UICONTROL Actions: Email]** right pane to create the content for the SMS message. 

    For more information on how to configure your journey, refer to this [page](../building-journeys/journey-gs.md).

* In a **Campaign**: once you created a campaign, select **[!UICONTROL Email]** as your action and define basic settings. 

    For more information on how to configure your campaign, refer to this [page](../campaigns/create-campaign.md#configure).

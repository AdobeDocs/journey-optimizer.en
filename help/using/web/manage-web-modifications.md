You can easily manage all the components, adjustments and styles you added to your web page. You can also add modifications directly from the dedicated pane.

## Work with the Modifications pane {#use-modifications-pane}

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Modifications]** icon to display the corresponding pane on the left.

    >Proceed with care when deleting an action as it may impact subsequent actions.

1. Use the **[!UICONTROL More actions]** button on top of the **[!UICONTROL Modifications]** pane to delete all modifications at once.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL More actions]** menu you can also delete only the invalid modifications, meaning the changes that were overriden by other changes. For example, if you modify the color of a text and then you delete that text, the color modification becomes invalid as the text does not exist anymore.

1. You can also cancel and redo actions using the **[!UICONTROL Undo/Redo]** button on top right of the screen.

    Click and hold the button to switch between the **[!UICONTROL Undo]** and **[!UICONTROL Redo]** options. Then click the button itself to apply the desired action.

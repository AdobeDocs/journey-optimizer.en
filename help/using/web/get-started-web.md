# Get started with web channel {#get-sarted-web}

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>This capability is only available with the [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] **Prime** and **Ultimate** [packages](https://helpx.adobe.com/legal/product-descriptions/adobe-journey-optimizer.html).

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to visually author and deliver personalized web experiences to your customers.

If you are already using outbound channels such as email, SMS or push notifications, you can now leverage the inbound web channel to offer a truly personalized experience that spans across all channels.

Through an intuitive visual interface, this capability allows you to modify your web properties easily in order to experiment, optimize and personalize your end-user campaigns.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Currently in [!DNL Journey Optimizer] you can only create web experiences using **campaigns**.

Once you created a campaign, select **Web** as your action and define basic settings. For more information on how to configure your campaign, refer to this [page](../campaigns/create-campaign.md#configure).

If this is your first time creating a web experience, make sure you follow the prerequisites described in [this section](web-prerequisites.md).

This will increase your total engageable profile count, which may have cost implications if the contractual number of engageable profiles you purchased is exceeded.

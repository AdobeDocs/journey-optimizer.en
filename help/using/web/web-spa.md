**Single-page applications** (SPAs) can now be authored in the web designer visual editor. This allows you to select which specific views you want to apply your web page modifications to.

A view can be defined as a whole site or a group of visual elements on a site, such as the home page, the entirety of the products site or the delivery preferences frame on all the checkout pages.

One-time developer setup is needed to define the views in the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK implementation. This enables you to create and run Adobe Journey Optimizer web campaigns on SPAs.

## Define views in the Web SDK implementation {#define-views}

XDM views can be leveraged in Adobe [!DNL Journey Optimizer] to empower marketers to run web personalization and experimentation campaigns on SPAs via the web visual editor. [Learn more](web-spa-implementation.md)

To be able to access and author views in the [!DNL Journey Optimizer] user interface, make sure you follow the steps listed in [this section](web-spa-implementation.md#implement-xdm-views).

## Discover views in the web designer {#discover-views}

Once SPAs setup is done in the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK implementation, you need to navigate through all the views of your website that you want to apply modifications to. Follow the steps below.

1. [Create a web campaign](create-web.md) and access the [web designer](edit-web-content.md).

    The view you are currently in is displayed on top left.

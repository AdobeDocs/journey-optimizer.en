### Improvements {#e-improvements}

This release comes with the improvements listed below.

**SMS channel**

SMS enhancements have been introduced to improve your messaging capabilities:

* You can define and manage unique keywords for your SMS campaigns and journeys, enabling more personalized and efficient communication.
* You can create and deliver a default SMS message when a keyword is not recognized.

**Frequency and priority management**

* **Frequency capping by campaign or journey** - You can now create frequency rules to apply to your journeys, allowing you to limit the number of journeys per day, week, or month, as well as control the number of concurrent journeys running simultaneously.

* **Priority score** - You can now assign a priority score to a campaign or a journey, ranging from 0 to 100. A higher number indicates a higher priority. When two campaigns or journeys use the same surface, Journey Optimizer will select the one with the highest priority score. If the campaigns have the same score, the campaign that was most recently modified will be chosen. Priority score is available for all inbound channels in campaigns, and for the in-app channel in journeys.    

* **View conflicts** - A new **View conflicts** button in journeys and campaigns now allows you to check whenever there's a possibility of overlap with other journeys or campaigns such as the start date, the targeted audience, or the selected channel configuration.
 
**Decision management**

* **Audits** - The **Change log** tab allowing you to see all the changes that have been made to an offer or a decision has been removed. Changes related to offers and decisions can now be seen in the **Audits** menu.


**Configuration**

* **Surface personalization** - When using a personalized configuration in a campaign or a journey, you can now preview your email content to check for potential errors with the dynamic settings you defined.    

**Journeys** 

* **Path experiment in journeys** - With the journey path experiment, you can now define and track key metrics for your journey paths, allowing you to measure the impact of your activities and to provide clearer insights into your performance. 

* **Max number of Live journeys** - Journey Optimizer now has a guardrail of 500 live journeys on production sandboxes, instead of 100. The number of live journeys is visible in the journey canvas. <!-- DOCAC-10977-->

* **Time-to-live guardrail** - Starting November 1st, 2024, a time-to-live (TTL) guardrail will be enforced on Journey Optimizer system-generated datasets as follows:

    * 90 days for data in profile store
    * 13 months for data in data lake

Additionally, at that time, streaming segmentation will no longer support the use of send and feedback events from tracking and feedback datasets. We have been recommending not to use those events for streaming segmentation for a while and now we will disable them altogether.

* This change only restricts the use of send/open events in streaming segmentation; click events can still be used in a streaming segment. Also, send/open events can still be used in a batch segment. 
* Tracking data will still be collected. This change does not impact tracking. You can still track to whom an email was sent and who clicked on an email.
* Reaction events in Journeys are not impacted by this change.

* **Parameters in custom actions** (Availability date: Oct 3, 2024) - NULL and optional parameters are now supported in custom actions. [Learn more](../action/about-custom-action-configuration.md#define-the-message-parameters)

**Data governance & Consent policies** - Availability date: Oct 7, 2024
  
* **Data governance policies** enforcement now takes place across all channels in Journey Optimizer. For customers that have created  policies in Adobe Experience Platform, these are applied to marketing actions as part of the channel configurations setup. When you create content using a configuration, the system checks all the personalization fields for any data governance violations. If a violation is found, publishing a journey or campaign will not be possible. [Learn more](../action/action-privacy.md)

* **Custom consent policies** now apply to all Journey Optimizer channels. On enforcement before a message is sent or an inbound experience is delivered, the system checks that the user has given consent to use personalization fields in the content that they will receive. If no consent is given, the experience will not be displayed. [Learn more](../action/consent.md)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Consent policies are currently only available for organizations that have purchased the Adobe **Healthcare Shield** or **Privacy and Security Shield** add-on offerings.

**Audiences** -  Availability date: Oct 8, 2024

* When targeting a CSV file audience, you can now use attributes from the file in the personalization editor and in journeys and campaigns rule builer. [Learn more](../audience/about-audiences.md)

* The use of audiences and attributes from custom upload (CSV file) is now available for use with Healthcare Shield or Privacy and Security Shield.

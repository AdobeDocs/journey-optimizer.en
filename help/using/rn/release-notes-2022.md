<th><strong>Journeys - Optimize your IP ramp up with Profile cap conditions</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>When configuring a <strong>Condition</strong> activity in a journey, you can now define a profile cap. This new condition type allows you to set a maximum number of profiles for a journey path. When this limit is reached, the entering profiles take an alternate path. This allows you to ramp up the volume of your deliveries (IP ramp up). For example, you may want to ramp up your deliveries on a domain by splitting the execution: send 1000 messages on day 1, 2000 on day 2, etc.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../building-journeys/condition-activity.md#profile_cap">detailed documentation</a> and related <a href="../building-journeys/ramp-up-deliveries-uc.md">sample use case</a>.</p>

### Improvements {#sept-2023-improvements}

This release comes with the improvements listed below.

**Personalization**

* In addition to visual fragments, it is now possible to create, save and reuse expression fragments from the Journey Optimizer interface through the Expression Editor. Expression fragments replace the previously saved expressions. [Learn more](../personalization/use-expression-fragments.md)

**Alerting**

* A new type of system alert has been introduced. You can now get notified when a **Read Audience** activity fails. [Learn more](../reports/alerts.md).

**Web channel**

* Single-page applications (SPAs) can be now authored in the web visual editor, which allows you to select which specific views you want to apply your web page modifications to. A view can be defined as a whole site or a group of visual elements on a site, such as the home page, the entirety of the products site or the delivery preferences frame on all the checkout pages. One-time developer setup is needed to define the views in the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK implementation; this enables marketers to create and run Adobe Journey Optimizer web campaigns on SPAs. [Learn more](../web/web-spa.md)

* When editing a page using the web designer, you can now add new changes to your content directly from the Modifications pane - without the need to select a component and edit it from the designer interface. [Learn more](../web/manage-web-modifications.md#add-modifications)

* When setting up web subdomains, you now have the option of adding you own subdomain - in addition to using a subdomain already delegated to Adobe. [Learn more](../web/web-delegated-subdomains.md#web-configure-new-subdomain)

**Journeys**

* When duplicating a journey, you can now define the name of the journey copy. [Learn more](../building-journeys/journey-gs.md#uplicate-a-journey)



* Support of custom action responses is now GA. This capability allows you to leverage API call responses in custom actions and orchestrate your journey based on these responses. In addition, a new guardrail has been added to limit all customs actions to 150,000 calls over 30 seconds per endpoint. [Learn more](../action/action-response.md)
<!--
* The maximum duration that you can define in the Wait activity is now 29 days instead of 30.
-->

**Email channel**

* A new option in the email surface configuration allows to choose to send transactional messages to profiles even if their email addresses are on the Adobe [!DNL Journey Optimizer] suppression list. [Learn more](../email/email-settings.md#send-to-suppressed-email-addresses)

**SMS channel**

* Two new fields, **Opt-in message** and **Help message**, have been added to the API configuration screen, allowing users to customize responses for inbound keywords. Note that this is only available for Sinch SMS provider. [Learn more](../sms/sms-configuration.md#create-api)

* SMS opt-out is no longer managed at the channel level. It is now number-specific, meaning that if some profiles opt out from a given number or short code, you are still able to send them messages from other numbers you may be using to send out SMS messages. A new option enables you to select the **Opt-out number** you want to use for a given surface. [Learn more](../sms/sms-configuration.md#message-preset-sms)

**Direct mail channel**

* You can now encrypt files intended for your direct mail providers when they are transferred to a server. To do this, a new field is available in the file routing configuration screen, allowing you to copy-paste your encryption key. [Learn more](../direct-mail/direct-mail-configuration.md)

**Reporting**

* You can now export Journey Optimizer reports as CSV file. Learn more in the [detailed documentation](../reports/global-report.md#export-reports) and the [how-to video](../reports/global-report.md#video-csv).

**Assets**

* A new option for Assets allows you to choose the repository for your Assets in Journey Optimizer. You can opt for either an Assets Essentials repository or an Assets as a Cloud Service repository, provided you own this solution. [Learn more](../content-management/assets-essentials.md)

<!--**Decision management**

Enhancements have been made to the audience picker in journeys or campaigns, with the addition of new columns displaying the origin and update frequency of audiences.    -->

### Improvements {#july-2023-improvements}

This release comes with the improvements listed below.


**Campaigns**

Contextual events related to campaigns are now available for use in the personalization editor "Contextual attributes" menu.


**Audiences**

Enhancements have been made to the audience picker in journeys or campaigns, with the addition of new columns displaying the origin and update frequency of audiences. With the release of the Audience Composition portal, Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Journey Optimizer have updated the usage of "audiences" and "segment" within the system and the documentation.

* Audience: A set of people, accounts, households, or other entities that share common characteristics and behaviors.
* Segment definition: In Adobe Experience Platform, the rules used to describe key characteristics or behavior of a target audience. This term was formerly known just as "segment".

As a result, within Adobe Journey Optimizer and the Adobe Experience Platform UI, "Segments" are replaced with "Audiences" to reflect this new path of audience creation and management.

**APIs**

The JWT method to generate access tokens for Adobe Journey Optimizer APIsauthentication has been deprecated. All new integrations must be created using the OAuth Server-to-Server authentication method. Adobe also recommends that you migrate your existing integrations to the OAuth method. [Learn more](https://developer.adobe.com/journey-optimizer-apis/references/authentication/){target="_blank"}.


**Other changes**

Journey Optimizer datasets export to Cloud Storage Destinations is now available to all customers as a public beta. This feature allows you to establish a live connection with cloud storage locations in order to export the content of your datasets. [Learn more](../data/export-datasets.md)

### Improvements {#may-2023-improvements}

**Audiences**

* In preparation for the generally availability of the Audience Portal feature, Adobe Experience Platform is updating the usage of "audiences" and "segment" within the system and the documentation.

    * Audience: A set of people, accounts, households, or other entities that share common characteristics and behaviors.

### Improvements {#mar-2023-improvements}

**Journeys**

* The new **Throttling API** allows you to set a limit on the number of events sent per second, preventing overwhelming traffic spikes on your external systems or API. When the set limit is reached, all subsequent API calls are queued and processed as soon as possible, in the order they were received. Please note that this feature supports only one throttling configuration across all your sandboxes. [Learn more](../configuration/external-systems.md)
* The Journey canvas has been enhanced for a simpler and improved user experience. At the end of each path in the canvas, the empty place holders have been removed. You can now simply add your activities by dragging them at the end of a path.
* In the journey canvas, the label of the **End** tag is no longer automatically set with the previous activity's name. Users can manually add a custom label if needed.

**Personalization**

* You can now include default fallback text for string-based profile attributes in the Expression Editor. These values will display if the selected attributes return no result. [Learn more](../personalization/personalization-build-expressions.md#add)

+++ Learn more about Performance Measurement

The **[!UICONTROL Objective]** tab of your Campaign report allows you to better fine-tune your deliveries' reports by targeting one specific metric. With this feature, you can effectively track and analyze your campaign's performance and make informed decisions to improve your results.

The **[!UICONTROL Objectives]** listed are linked to **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** that define a connection to a system in order to retrieve additional information. A list of pre-configured **[!UICONTROL Objectives]** is available, but you can also customize your report by adding new **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** and defining your own objectives. 

By selecting the desired Objectives, the **[!UICONTROL Performance overview]** and **[!UICONTROL Campaign objective]** widgets provide a comprehensive and insightful summary of your delivery performance, allowing you to closely monitor and evaluate the success of your campaign.

With the **[!UICONTROL Campaign objective]** widget, you can also choose to compare your primary objective against another performance metric.

Note that each widget can be resized and deleted as needed.

### Improvements {#feb-2023-improvements}

**Journeys**

* The **Re-entrance wait period** field has been added to the journey properties. This field allows you to define the time to wait before allowing a profile to enter the journey again in unitary journeys (starting with an event or an audience qualification). This prevents journeys from being erroneously triggered multiple times for the same event. By default the field is set to 5 minutes. [Learn more](../building-journeys/journey-gs.md#entrance)

* Improvements have been made for **journey start and end dates**. If you have not specified a start date, it is now automatically added at publication time. For **Read audience** journeys, you can now add an end date. This allows profiles to exit automatically when the date is reached. [Learn more](../building-journeys/journey-gs.md#dates)

<!--

* The Journey canvas has been enhanced for a simpler and improved user experience. At the end of each path in the canvas, the empty placeholders have been removed. You can now simply add your activities by dragging them anywhere between nodes. [Learn more](../building-journeys/using-the-journey-designer.md)

* Timeout and error management has been improved in journeys. Timeout and error paths are now always added on the canvas. A new toolbar button is available to show/hide these paths. [Learn more](../building-journeys/journey-gs.md#timeout_and_error)

* A new type of system alert has been introduced. You can now get notified when a custom action fails. [Learn more](../reports/alerts.md)

You must have it configured or use another one. [Learn more](../email/email-settings.md#reply-to-email)

* **Email surface** - In the **URL tracking parameters** section of the email surface settings, the limit for each **Value** field has been updated from 255 characters to 5 KB for compatibility with Adobe Analytics tracking. [Learn more](../email/email-settings.md#url-tracking)

**Decision management**

* **Placements** - Additional parameters have been added in placements creation screen. They allow you to control whether an offer can be duplicated across multiple placements, and to specify if the offer's content and metadata should be included in the API response. [Learn more](../offers/offer-library/creating-placements.md)

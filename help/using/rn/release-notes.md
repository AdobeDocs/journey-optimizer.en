### Improvements {#jan-26-01-improv}

Improvements coming with this release are listed below.

#### AI

* **AI Assistant Content Quality Checks** - In addition to brand alignment, you can now evaluate overall <strong>content quality</strong> to uncover potential issues with readability, cohesiveness, and effectiveness, independent of your brand guidelines. These automated checks help identify unclear messaging, inconsistent tone, or structural gaps.

* **Update brands with new color tab** - Brand guidelines help ensure your brand is presented consistently across all touchpoints. The new <strong>Colors section</strong> defines the standards for your brand's color system, outlining how colors are selected, organized, and applied across experiences. It ensures consistent use of primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors to support a cohesive, accessible, and recognizable brand identity.

#### Campaigns

* **Schedule Campaign using Profile Time Zone** - Campaign scheduling can now use each profile's <strong>time zone</strong> to deliver messages at the intended local time. Scheduling using profile time zones is available for Email, Push, SMS, WhatsApp, and LINE channels.

  **Note**: This improvement is only available for a set of organizations (Limited Availability).


#### Experience Decisioning

* **Self-service migration tooling APIs** - A new set of <strong>migration tooling APIs</strong> is available to migrate Offer management entities to Experience Decisioning. The tooling enables seamless migration between sandboxes with dependency resolution and rollback capabilities.

* **Attach fragments to decision items** - Journey Optimizer now provides the ability to attach <strong>fragments</strong> to decision items which can be leveraged in code-based experience campaigns through decision policies.

  **Note**: Previously released in Limited Availability, this improvement is now available to all environments (General Availability).

#### Journeys

* **Leverage a failure response payload in journey Custom Actions** - You can now define an optional <strong>error response payload</strong> for custom actions. When a call fails, the error payload is exposed in the journey context and is available in the timeout/error branch to support richer fallback logic and debugging.

* **Combine native and Adobe Campaign message actions** - Journey Optimizer now lets you combine Adobe Campaign v7/v8 message actions with native channel actions in the same journey.

* **Journey payload size validation in journeys** - Journey Optimizer now provides <strong>payload size validation</strong> to help ensure optimal performance and system stability. When building or publishing journeys, you receive clear warnings and errors if payload sizes approach or exceed recommended limits, along with actionable guidance to optimize your journey configuration. This proactive validation helps you identify potential issues early and maintain journey performance.

* **Multiple inbound actions in journeys** - To simplify your journey orchestration, you can now define <strong>multiple inbound actions</strong> in a single journey. Previously available in campaigns, this capability enables you to deliver multiple code-based experiences, In-app messages, Content Cards or web actions to different locations at the same time, each action containing a specific content.

  **Note**: Previously released in Limited Availability, this improvement is now available to all environments (General Availability).

#### Orchestrated campaigns

* **Select attributes and copy distribution values** - You can now select or copy values directly from the distribution of values view in orchestrated campaigns.

* **Data usage label inheritance for audiences** - <strong>Data usage labels</strong> applied in Adobe Experience Platform now automatically carry over when saving audiences in orchestrated campaigns, reducing manual DULE tagging.

* **Predefined retargeting filters** - To support easier retargeting for orchestrated campaign use cases, this release introduces new <strong>retargeting filters</strong>. These filters let you directly target audiences based on message engagement, such as sent, opened only, opened or clicked, or opened and clicked, and select the specific campaign or in-transition campaign you want to retarget.

* **Predefined filters with parameters** - You can now create <strong>filters with parameters</strong> in orchestrated campaigns for reusable, editable rules.

* **Message confirmation before send** - A <strong>confirmation step</strong> is now enabled by default before sending orchestrated campaigns to reduce accidental sends.

* **User-generated metadata support** - The <strong>executionMetadata helper function</strong> is now available in the personalization editor for Orchestrated Campaigns, enabling you to attach contextual information to any native action and store it in a dataset for export to external systems.

* **Restart button** - Orchestrated campaigns now include a <strong>restart button</strong> so you can quickly re-launch runs when needed before publishing the campaign.

* **Rate control support** - Orchestrated campaigns now support <strong>rate control</strong> to help you pace deliveries and align with volume constraints.

#### Permissions

* **Prevent self-approval for journeys and campaigns** - You can now require that creators cannot approve their own journeys or campaigns, improving <strong>separation of duties</strong> in approval workflows.

## Coming soon {#jan-26-01-coming-soon}

In the next few days, the following capabilities and enhancements are scheduled for release. **Information is subject to change**. Updated links, screens, and documentation will be shared once these updates are live in production.

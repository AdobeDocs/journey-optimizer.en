### Improvements {#jan24-improvements}

This release comes with the improvements listed below.

**Reporting**
 
* **New domain based breakdown widgets** - New widgets have been added to enhance your Campaign and Journey reports. The **Bounce Reasons by domain**, **Sent & delivered by domains**, **Opens & Clicks by domain** and **Bounce & errors by domain** widgets provide a detailed breakdown at the domain level for key email delivery and tracking metrics. [Learn more](../reports/channel-report.md) 

**SMS Channel**

* **Double Opt-In** - The Double Opt-In workflow for SMS guarantees that users explicitly opt-in to receive messages when the request is initiated from their device. Users initiate the consent process by sending an inbound SMS message. Upon confirming their consent, a follow-up message is sent, requesting final verification. If a user profile does not exist, it is created upon successful confirmation. [Learn more](../sms/sms-configuration.md#create-api) 

   Note that this capability is available with Sinch and Infobip SMS providers.

**Journeys**

* **Reaction events duration** - The maximum duration that you can define in the **Reaction events** is now 29 days instead of 30. [Learn more](../building-journeys/reaction-events.md)

<!--* **Date filters** - You can now use custom dates to filter the journeys inventory, in addition to the existing predefined date filters. This allows you to refine the list by displaying journeys published on a specific date, within a particular month, throughout an entire year, or within specified time ranges. [Learn more](../building-journeys/journey-gs.md#filter)-->

* **Read audience**  - The **Read Audience** activity now relies on the profile snapshot dataset for batch segments, which is only generated once a day after the scheduled daily batch job is run, hence the data will be fresh up to that last daily batch job.

* **Field Groups** - This release fixes an issue which was blocking Field Groups from being saved in certain cases.

**Frequency Rules**

* **Weekly and daily frequency cap** - You can now specify the maximum number of messages sent to a customer profile in a week or a day, in addition to month. The frequency cap is based on the selected calendar period and reset at the beginning of the corresponding time frame. [Learn more](../configuration/frequency-rules.md#create-new-rule)

**Decision management**

* **Frequency capping on Edge** - The frequency capping counter is now updated and available in an Edge Decisioning API decision in less than 3 seconds.

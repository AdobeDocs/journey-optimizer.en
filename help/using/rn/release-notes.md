### Improvements {#24-9-improvements}

This release comes with the improvements listed below.

**Audiences**

<!--* The use of audiences from custom upload (CSV file) is now available for use with Privacy and Security Shield add-on.
* When targeting a custom upload (CSV file) audience, you can now use attributes from the file in your campaigns and journeys. These attributes are available in the personalization editor, to personalize your messages, and the journey advanced expression editor.-->
* (Availability date: Sept 17) **License usage** - The License usage dashboard now shows the Engageable Profiles, instead of Engageable Audiences. [Learn more](../audience/license-usage.md)

**Content management**

* You can now export content templates and fragments between sandboxes.

**Data Governance**

* You can now apply data governance policies to Journey Optimizer channels, in addition to custom actions within journeys. This enhancement helps prevent the use of sensitive fields in communications by applying marketing actions directly within your channel configurations.    

<!--
**Frequency and priority management**

* **Frequency capping by campaign or journey** - You can now create frequency rules to apply to your journeys, allowing you to limit the number of journeys per day, week, or month, as well as control the number of concurrent journeys running simultaneously.

* **Priority score** - You can now assign a priority score to a campaign or a journey, ranging from 0 to 100. A higher number indicates a higher priority. When two campaigns or journeys use the same surface, Journey Optimizer will select the one with the highest priority score. If the campaigns have the same score, the campaign that was most recently modified will be chosen. Priority score is available for all inbound channels in campaigns, and for the in-app channel in journeys.    

* **View conflicts** - A new **View conflicts** button in journeys and campaigns now allows you to check whenever there's a possibility of overlap with other journeys or campaigns such as the start date, the targeted audience, or the selected channel configuration.
-->


**Journeys** 

<!-- DOCAC-10977 * **Max number of Live journeys** - Journey Optimizer now has a guardrail of 500 live journeys on production sandboxes, instead of 100. The number of live journeys is visible in the journey canvas.-->

* **Live reporting enhancements** - Live Reporting provides insights into the performance of your journeys over the past 24 hours. We've enhanced it by adding new metrics (entered, exited, discarded profiles and profiles in error) allowing you to gain a deeper understanding of user behavior and performance directly from the Journey canvas. [Learn more](../building-journeys/report-journey.md)

<!-- DOCAC-10562* **Parameters in custom actions** - NULL and optional parameters are now supported in custom actions. [Learn more](../action/about-custom-action-configuration.md#define-the-message-parameters)-->

* (Availability date: Sept 10) **Automatic retries on Read Audience** - Retries are now applied by default on audience-triggered journeys (starting with a **Read Audience** or a **Business Event**) while retrieving the export job. If an error occurs during the export job creation, retries will be made every 10mn, for 1 hour max. After that, we will consider it as a failure. Those types of journeys can therefore be executed up to 1 hour after the scheduled time. [Learn more](../building-journeys/read-audience.md#retries)

**Email channel**

* **BCC message header** - A new header has been added to all email messages. This header's value is unique to each sent email and to its corresponding BCC email copy. This header is also stored in the message and BCC feedback datasets, which allows to reconcile the BCC copy and the corresponding sent email information.

* **Spam scoring** (GA)- You can now check your content spam scoring in a dedicated Spam report. Using SpamAssassin, Adobe Journey Optimizer can now test your email content and give it a score to indicate if ISPs or Mailbox providers will consider it as a spam or not. [Read more](../content-management/spam-report.md)

**SMS channel**

* **Edit API Credentials** - You can now edit settings in SMS API Credentials, including updates to opt-in/out keywords and replies.

**APIs**

* **Campaign Simulation API** - Use this API to trigger proof job of a Campaign. Sending Campaign proof is an async process, the API will return a proofJobId which can be used to check the status of the proof. [Learn more](https://developer.adobe.com/journey-optimizer-apis/references/simulations/){target="_blank"}

* (Availability date: Sept 10) The [Adobe Journey Optimizer API documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/journey-optimizer-apis/references/simulations/){target="_blank"} is now interactive. Explore the API endpoints directly from the documentation pages to get immediate feedback and speed up your technical implementation. 


    All the API reference pages now have a **Try it** functionality that you can use to test API calls directly on the documentation website page. [Get the required authentication credentials](https://developer.adobe.com/journey-optimizer-apis/references/authentication/){target="_blank"} and start using the functionality to explore the API endpoints. 

    Use this new functionality to explore the requests to and the responses from API endpoints, to get immediate feedback and speed up your technical implementation. 

    >[!CAUTION]
    >
    >Be aware that by using the interactive API functionality on the documentation pages, you are making real API calls to the endpoints. Keep this in mind when experimenting with production sandboxes.

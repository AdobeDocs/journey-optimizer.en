# Release Notes {#release-notes}

This page lists all the new features and improvements for [!DNL Journey Optimizer]. You can also consult the [latest documentation updates](documentation-updates.md) page for more changes.


## January 2022 Release {#january-2022-release}

### New capabilities 

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Journeys - Optimize your IP ramp up with Profile cap conditions</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>When configuring a <strong>Condition</strong> activity in a journey, you can now define a profile cap. This new condition type allows you to set a maximum number of profiles for a journey path. When this limit is reached, the entering profiles take an alternate path. This allows you to ramp up the volume of your deliveries (IP ramp up). For example, you may want to ramp up your deliveries on a domain by splitting the execution: send 1000 messages on day 1, 2000 on day 2, etc.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../building-journeys/condition-activity.md#profile_cap">detailed documentation</a> and related <a href="../building-journeys/ramp-up-deliveries-uc.md">sample use case</a>.</p>

<th><strong>Journeys - Read segment improvement</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<!--p>You can now configure the <strong>Read Segment</strong> activity to target only the individuals who entered or exited the selected segment during a specific lookback period. For example, you can decide to only retrieve all the customers who entered the VIP segment since yesterday. Only the new VIP customers will be targeted. The customers who were already part of the segment before yesterday will be excluded.</p-->
<p>The <strong>Incremental read</strong> option has been added to recurring <strong>Read Segment</strong> activities. This option allows you to only target the individuals who entered the segment since the last execution of the journey. The first execution always targets all segment members.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../building-journeys/read-segment.md#configuring-segment-trigger-activity">detailed documentation</a>.

### Improvements

<!--
**Performances**
* The integration between Journey Optimizer and Adobe Campaign Classic has been optimized to improve performance. The capping default configuration has been changed to 4000 calls / 5 minutes.  
-->

**Journeys**

* Journey Optimizer step events can now be linked to other datasets in [Adobe Customer Journey Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-overview/cja-overview.html). The **profileID** field, in the built-in Journey Step Event schema, is now defined as an identity field. [Learn more](../reports/sharing-overview.md#integration-cja)

<!--
* To optimize performance and prevent obsolete resource usage, all journeys in test mode that have not been triggered for a week now switch back to the **Draft** status.
-->

**Offer Decisioning**

<!--* When simulating which offers will be delivered for a given test profile, you can now define simulation settings and use the mode view for your simulations. [Learn more](offers/offer-activities/simulation.md#define-simulation-settings)-->

* When you update an offer, fallback offer, offer collection, or offer decision which is directly or indirectly referenced in a published message, the updates are now automatically reflected in the corresponding message, without the need to republish it. [Learn more](../offers/offers-e2e.md#insert-decision-in-email)

**Administration**

* Administrators can now edit PTR records with a CNAME set up subdomain. [Learn more](../configuration/ptr-records.md#edit-ptr-subdomains-cname)

**Personalization**

* **Add to favorites** - To help improve efficiency when working with personalization weâ€™ve introduced the concept of saving favorites. Adding different attributes to your favorites menu provides quick access to your most frequency used items. [Learn more](../personalization/personalize.md#fav)

<!--

**Reporting**

* New metrics and widgets are now available in **Live** and **Global** reports to measure your offers' impact on recipients.
* Deliveries can now be filtered depending on their status:

    * From the Message Execution list, you can now exclude proofs from your deliveries' list.
    * From your Live/Global reports, you can choose to exclude journey test events.

    [Learn more](../message-monitoring.md)

* From your reports, you can now see if the [Send-Time Optimization](../building-journeys/journeys-message.md#send-time-optimization) option has been activated for a given delivery.

## November 2021 Release {#november-2021-release}

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>CNAME subdomain delegation</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Adobe Journey Optimizer now supports CNAMEs. A CNAME, or Canonical Name record, is a record that points to another domain address rather than an IP address. CNAME subdomain delegation enables you to create a subdomain and use CNAMEs to point to Adobe-specific records. Using this configuration, both you and Adobe share responsibility for maintaining DNS in order to setup environment for sending, rendering and tracking emails.</p>
<p>This method is recommended if your organization's policies restrict the full subdomain delegation method.</p>
<p>Learn more on CNAME subdomain delegation in the <a href="../configuration/delegate-subdomain.md#cname-subdomain-delegation">detailed documentation</a>.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>You can now trigger a journey targeting a subscription list. To perform this: add a Read segment activity followed by a message, and in the message email settings, define an expression that will fetch the subscriber email address from the profile, for the targeted subscription list. The expression editor has been enhanced to allow you to to select the first entry key of a map.</p>

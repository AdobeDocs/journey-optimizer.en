Adobe Journey Optimizer is releasing a new feature which improves the way you author content for Journey Optimizer channels (email, push, SMS). As a Journey Optimizer practitioner, you will now create and author your messages directly from a journey.

This feature requires a migration of existing journeys that are using messages.

Main changes in the UI are:

* Journey Action is 1:1 with the Message
* Message component in Journey Optimizer left rail is no longer available. Messages are created as actions.
* There is no separate library of messages: the journey now centralizes all components

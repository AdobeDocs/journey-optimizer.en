Adobe Journey Optimizer is releasing a new feature which improves the way practitioners author experiences for Journey Optimizer delivered channels like email, push, SMS. This feature requires a migration of existing Journeys that are using Messages. 

As a journey practitioner, you can now create and author your messages directly from a Journey.

Main changes in the UI are:

* Journey Action is 1:1 with the Message
* Message component in Journey Optimizer left rail is no longer available. Messages are created as actions.
* There is no separate library of messages: the journey now centralizes all components

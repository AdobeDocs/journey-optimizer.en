# Release Notes 2021 {#release-notes-2021}

This page lists all the features and improvements for [!DNL Journey Optimizer] released in 2021. 

## November 2021 Release {#november-2021-release}

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>CNAME subdomain delegation</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Adobe Journey Optimizer now supports CNAMEs. A CNAME, or Canonical Name record, is a record that points to another domain address rather than an IP address. CNAME subdomain delegation enables you to create a subdomain and use CNAMEs to point to Adobe-specific records. Using this configuration, both you and Adobe share responsibility for maintaining DNS in order to setup environment for sending, rendering and tracking emails.</p>
<p>This method is recommended if your organization's policies restrict the full subdomain delegation method.</p>
<p>Learn more on CNAME subdomain delegation in the <a href="../configuration/delegate-subdomain.md#cname-subdomain-delegation">detailed documentation</a>.</p>

### Improvements

**Journeys**

* **Expression editor** - As a power user, you can now use functions to work with maps. This capability can be leveraged with the subscription lists. As an example, from an audience, you can now get an email address from a subscription list. [Learn more in this sample](../building-journeys/message-to-subscribers-uc.md)

* **Monitoring** - Step events for live journeys and test mode have been enhanced. [New fields](../reports/sharing-field-list.md#serviceevents) have been added related to profile export jobs. For a better user experience, step event fields are now organized in different categories. All previous step events fields are still available in the [stepEvents](../reports/sharing-legacy-fields.md) category. 
* **Accessibility** - Accessibility enhancements have been implemented in journeys. 
* **Collections** - Arrays of objects containing sub-objects are now supported. [Read more](../building-journeys/collections.md)
* **Lists** - Lists screens have been improved for journeys, events, actions, data sources.

**Reporting**

* **Data format in Global view** - You can now toggle between numbers and percentages in the **Global view** of the **Execution** tab.


**Administration**

* **Edit message presets** - You can now edit message presets and monitor their update status. [Learn more](../configuration/channel-surfaces.md#edit-channel-surface)
* **Edit PTR records** - You can now edit PTR records and monitor their update status. [Learn more](../configuration/ptr-records.md#edit-ptr-record)

**Personalization**

* **New helper function for date formatting** - You can now specify how a date string should be represented. [Learn more](../personalization/functions/dates.md#format-date)
 

**Decision Management**

* **Evaluation sequencing** - The new and improved decision creation flow enables you to not only navigate between decision objects more seamlessly, but also gives you a complete control of how offer collections are evaluated by the decision engine. This includes which collections are evaluated together vs separately, and in what order the collections should be evaluated. [Learn more](../offers/offer-activities/create-offer-activities.md#add-decision-scopes)

### Fixes 

* Fixed an issue which prevented the Journey list, Message list and Email designer from being displayed when the browser language was not English.
* Fixed a syntax error which occured when adding personalization using an expression in the Email designer: characters were wrongly escaped.
* Fixed an issue which led to a 404 error when navigating in the **Administration** menu.
* Fixed an issue which triggered other live journeys when testing a journey using a business event.

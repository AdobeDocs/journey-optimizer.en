# New journey interface {#new-canvas}

We've worked on a simplification of the journey model aiming to facilitate some internal processes. This model change by itself is transparent for you, except that we took the opportunity to introduce new capabilities alongside: 

* A new Journey canvas design
* Live Reporting in accessible in the Journey canvas
* Improve the readability of the journey canvas and make activity design more scalable allowing us to provide more information at the activity level for current and future enhancements.

## Updates on the journey model

The new journey model will live alongside the existing one, meaning that there will be journeys using two different models:

* The old one, called "v1"
* And the new one, called "v2"

All journeys in v1 will stay in v1. You will still be able to edit, test or publish them. Any new version created from a v1 will stay in v1. There're no functional changes around v1 journeys.

You can see that a journey is in v1 with its canvas design:

If it contains round activities, it's a v1.

However, when you will create a new journey or duplicate an exiting one, it will be a v2 journey. Due to that, we expect to see less and less v1 journeys over time. Be reassure that we will still support existing live v1 journeys.

As we mentioned, this new model is transparent for users except for one limitation: it will not be possible to copy and paste activities from a v1 journey to a v2 and vice versa. We advise you to duplicate your v1 journey to automatically get a v2 one.

You can see that a journey is in v2 with the new canvas design (cf below):

Any new feature around the journey canvas (including Live Reporting) will be made available exclusively on v2 journeys.

## New Journey canvas design

With the new journey model we're introducing a redesigned Journey canvas, which fits seamlessly within the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions & app ecosystem, making for an intuitive and efficient user experience. Any journey in the v2 stack will be on that new design.

Activities will now be represented by squared boxes with:

* The first line representing the activity type which will often be overwritten by more contextual information (eg: on Read Audiences, it will contain the name of the selected audience), or by a custom label if you define one. 
* The second live always representing the activity type.

It is also more scalable allowing us to provide more information at the activity level, like we started to do with live reporting.

Expect to see new changes coming in the next few months around that new design!

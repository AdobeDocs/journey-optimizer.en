This page describes known issues in the product.

This content is subject to changes without prior notice.

**Expression Editor**

* When browsing to the personalization attributes in the expression list, the cursor position on the central section can disappear. (CJM-6756)
* The '+' icon is visible on all elements in the left pane, even containers encapsulating other attributes - which is not the correct behavior. For example, profile attributes which are maps should not be inserted into the expression editor. (CJM-6748)
* When inserting an offer decision in the Expression Editor with a syntax error, validation does not fail. (CJM-8461)

**Personalization**

* In the email editor, when using the contextual toolbar to add personalization in a text box, the **Add** button rendering is not correct and can lead to inserting the personalization block twice. (CJM-7575)

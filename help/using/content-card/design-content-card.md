# Design content cards content {#design-content-card}

The authoring construct for Cards provides a form-based authoring experience that provides marketers basic inputs that can be used to be rendered by the developer.

Once your content is defined and personalized, you can review and activate it. Your campaign will be sent according to the set schedule. [Learn more in this page](../campaigns/review-activate-campaign.md).

## Content tab {#content-tab}

From the **[!UICONTROL Content]** tab, you can customize your content cards by defining both their content and the design of the **[!UICONTROL Close]** button. Additionally, you can enhance your content with media and add action buttons directly from this tab.

### Close button {#close-button}
